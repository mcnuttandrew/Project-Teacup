We just kind of talked about stuff.",There was also something about all-you-can-eat.,"There was some sort of weird legal proceeding going on, somewhere between a court case and a congressional hearing, and it was about this little guy who had been caught in an explosion that was caused by the government.","The lawyer seemed much more interested in the case than he, and won it to great personal fame and acclaim, but later I found out that the guy really wasn't blind in either eye, that the blindness was temporary.",He didn't really want to sue the government that bad but his lawyer galvanized him into doing it.,"Some random person caught us, though, so we dipped as quick as possible but the guy had four really angry fucking dogs coming after us. The dogs went after T mostly so I hid behind some bushes for a while, but eventually two of the dogs found me. ","They ran up to me but I stayed as still as possible and offered them my hand, which they sniffed and licked until they were calm. The other two dogs were off still chasing somebody, but these two dogs just lay down with me and let me pet them."," One was a black dog and the other was a sort of husky, but only after a little while did I notice they were both cyborgs. I barely detected that they had mechanical parts stitched into their bodes all over.","After remaining super calm for a while, Tarek eventually found me and started petting the dogs with me, until he found out they were two of the dogs that were chasing us, at which point he wanted to get the fuck out of there.","We got up carefully and started walking calmly away, and the dogs trotted after us for a bit. ","I notice that everyone's walking towards a nearby lake where a boat is playing Christmas carols, and no one is really paying attention to us walking the other way, but for some reason T still decides to start running, which spooks the dogs. ","The black dog, who's with me, starts nipping my legs, causing me to jump, at which point the dog gets underneath me and I accidentally fall on his neck. ","I roll off as quickly as possible, but then the dog launches himself at me in a rage and wraps his jaws around my head. I then promptly woke up.","I'm walking from Seattle to Portland, with who I think is my mother. We've been walking for an extremely long time when we cross a river, and all of a sudden everything seems very familiar to me."," We're on the bank of a river, and if we follow the river through a couple more bends we'll come to a park that I know of. I have never seen this park ever before, and yet it seems incredibly familiar to me. ","I think I'm meeting someone there, but I can't remember who or for what.","My parents weren't even that surprised to see me, which was odd. They did, however, move their computer over to the TV, so they were using our TV as their monitor, which was awesome and I now want to find out if that's possible at all.","I decided to go in during school hours to throw the security force off even more, so I made my way in by a roof access, which lead me to a boiler room and then through several empty offices.","I ran into some students here and there, but I was absolutely ruthless about leaving them on the floor with a few silenced bullets in their foreheads."," Eventually I was making good progress down a major hallway when I ran into my arch nemesis, who was some dude who I was apparently really good friends with but he was heading the security forces and thus had to kill me. ","Since we sort of walked into each other, we were trying to figure out a fair way to solve the issue, and I suggested pistols at dawn because I had always wanted to do pistols at dawn. ","He found that suggestion to be a highly reasonable one, after which the two of us walked around pistols in hand looking for someone to officiate the match, which no one really seemed that inclined to do, unsurprisingly.","I'm here at Reed, and for some reason my grandmother is coming to visit me here. She doesn't look like either of my actual grandmothers, but I don't really seem to notice or care, so when she arrives, I start to take her on a tour around campus. ","Somehow this seems to line up perfectly with Renn Fayre, so as we're walking around the campus we walk by the ""senior dorm"", which doesn't actually exist, but is placed on one end of the Old Dorm Block.","It's pretty much a dead-end hallway on the first floor, and so as we're walking by I look down the hallway and see that it's filled with naked Gaelic women singing some of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. ","I don't really remember what happened to my grandmother after that, because I just sort of joined this crowd of people who formed an audience, sitting silently at the end of the hallway, entranced by the music and women. ","Because it's Renn Fayre and all, the entire hallway is decked out in tiny streams and mossy rocks and so forth, and the longer I stay sitting in this audience, the more I forget that I'm at Reed at all.", Eventually I just kind of forget everything about my surroundings and let myself be consumed by the feeling of well-being. In retrospect I think they might have been sirens.,"It's my senior year of high school, and I have to write some sort of final paper, but for some reason I, along with everyone else in my graduating class, am assigned to go to the Lowell Elementary School cafeteria to write my paper.","As I'm sitting in the cafeteria, at one of the long tables set up in rows, Ms. Anderson comes in to watch over us, and for some reason she has a microphone and she's occasionally saying stuff to the group. ","I'm at a table with Griffin and Caleb, so as she's passing by our table, she looks at me, laughs, and says so here I guess is the group of people who think genetics equals kinetics. I find this hysterically funny. ","Later she passes by Andrew's table and makes some assessment of them, which of course Andrew is bummed out and disappointed by. Also at some point I think someone stole my card, but he realized it wasn't his and gave it back.","I'm back at NSCC for the first day of classes, and the first class on my schedule is some history class being taught by someone named John Klugerman, on the 6th floor of some building.","This seems odd, though, because I only know of 5 floors in that building, and when I get up the fifth floor, I find some other class being taught. ","After asking that instructor, though, he leads me to a trap door that leads up to the only room on the 6th floor, and sure enough, there's my class. ","The person teaching the class is Joe, though, and the girl from Anna Mann who's always with him. The two of them apparently petitioned the administration for a certain class, and were told to run the class themselves. ","At the start of class, the first thing they did was make everyone be really quiet, which seemed to be a problem for these two girls in front of me that didn't want to do anything but talk. They would lecture in barely above a whisper.","I'm at the Seattle Science Center with Tucker, Darin, and my dad. We caught a shuttle bus from somewhere in the south end to go see this exhibit, except I'm not entirely sure it was an exhibit and not just an outright family fun center. ","There were arcade games, laser tag, and this giant rock wall set up. ","The rock wall was crazy, because it covered an entire wall of what appeared to be a giant conference hall, and in one corner, it actually went up to the top of the roof and then through it, so you could climb outside if you wanted to.","I'm pretty sure I saw Frankie Pavia at one point about to make it through the hole in the roof. However, there was this section right below the hole in the roof that appeared to be pretty difficult,","However, since I was wearing no harness and attached to no rope, the employees running the whole thing noticed and immediately tried to get me off the wall, saying I didn't have proper equipment or shoes or anything. ","I was pretty good at climbing barefoot, but they weren't having any of it. After a little bit of arguing, they started to climb up after me, so I just traversed across to this saddle where I could climb on."," The employees didn't seem particularly amused by this, and I was escorted off the premises. I think my dad paid some kind of fee, as well. ","We realized it was about time to make it back to the shuttle bus, so we make our way to a coffee shop to get some coffee before heading back to the pick-up point. ","At this coffee place, which is apparently really nearby the airport, they have a bunch of weed for sale, including already heated weed that you can just scoop up into a hookah and smoke right there."," They were advertising it as ""the last weed you'll be able to get before you leave the state"" which apparently appealed to the all the business men that were about to catch flights at the nearby airport."," All of a sudden, though, Darin comes running and tells us that we're about to miss the shuttle bus, so we abandon the idea of getting coffee and start running for the pick-up point. ","As we're leaving the coffee shop, though, I notice out of the corner of my eye a plastic bag in the trash can, and almost out of instinct I just grab it as we're headed out the door. ","When we make it back to the pick-up point, the shuttle bus is literally just starting to pull away when we run up, and he stops and lets us in.","I noticed he's on the phone on the sidewalk outside and I realize that he's just going to go hang out with someone around downtown, and thus doesn't need the shuttle ride back to the south end.","As we're driving away, I remember the plastic bag in my pocket, and sure enough, I reach into it and there's a bit of trash there which apparently someone was just going to throw away."," I then realized that having the bag open to feel what's inside might let out enough smell that my dad would notice, since he's sitting next to me in the shuttle bus, so I quickly close it up and stuff it back down in my pocket.","I'm playing what I thought was Halo 2 co-op online, but it turned out to be some kind of MMO game with hundreds of people playing the same level at the same time. ","It was really confusing, and they're were Spartans everywhere, and so I ran around until a banshee found me and then skyjacked it, and flew around. I think I was at Woodbridge playing on my computer.","In my dream, I wake up on the balcony at Woodbridge. I remembered correctly where I was, but beyond that I was totally amnesic. I didn't remember how I got there, how long I'd been there, or who anyone was there."," I looked across at the other balcony, where all the modifications have been made, and they were different than I was expecting, but I didn't go over and investigate closer, instead I headed down to the playing fields and found Fred.","I started asking him questions about when I got there and how I got there, and he told me I had arrived the night before, with Andrew. The problem was that I simply didn't remember this at all, nor did I remember arriving the night before.",I correctly guessed that it would have been Thursday at that point. ,"I spent a lot of time looking around looking confused, and a lot of people saw me and giggled to themselves.","It looks incredibly dark outside, which is very confusing, since it's only 11:30 in the morning. Regardless, everyone, including my family, heads for the only open hotel in town, and in the process completely mobs it."," As we're standing in line, we run into Ben and his mother, and he tells us about a marathon he just recently ran. ","I kind of wander off into the rain, and sure enough, as I peer into the sky I see patches of blue sky here and there through the downpour, which is intermittent along with the thunder and lightning. ","My family seems rather intent on staying put for the moment, and I'm in no mood to argue with them, so we end up staying there, but I remain rather confused all the while. I wasn't using my bike, I was using a bike similar to my dad's bike.","Im in a big mansion somewhere, hiding from some military. I'm hiding in a bedroom, and I'm given a bunch of balloons, and told to walk out the front door. Though this seems a bit crazy, I do it anyway, and sure enough I float away up into the air.","I run back to the mansion to find that this kid who was being a decoy for me got captured, and with the aid of a pair of binoculars and a mirror in a house several blocks away, we find out the kid is being tortured in said house.","As painful as it looks, we decide that we can't risk helping him, and eventually he is shot and dies.",Someone ended up playing this extremely twisted version of Donkey Kong involving portals and hand-to-hand combat.,"I'm being dropped off at some field trip or something by my dad. I realize it's a dream, and sort of float out of the car, but then I hit something and totally forget that I'm in a dream. On the field trip, there's this giant playground somewhere.","There are kids everywhere, but regardless I'm enjoying myself acting like a total monkey all over the play structure. I'm barely using my feet at all, but I'm swinging around the entire structure and it's loads of fun. ","The guy who actually talked to me wasn't even a police officer, though, he was a paramedic who was there for completely unknown reasons. ","I'm using Skype to have a video chat with someone, and as I push the button to talk with them, I accidentally hit Burnie Burns' name on my contacts list. The fact that his name is on my contacts list at all doesn't seem to be out of the ordinary.","He actually answers, and when he does, his face is right next to the camera, taking up the whole picture, and he whispers to me ""I love my job!"" ","Apparently they're filming one of the RT Shorts, and it just devolved into the two girls making out and Mr Burns slyly filming it. Also he apparently bought the poker table recently, and is shocked to discover a hidden pocket on the table.","I'm climbing on massive, gigantic climbing structure out in the middle of nowhere. It seems vaguely familiar, like I've dreamt of it before, but I can never really put my finger on it. The thing is essentially a man-made mountain.","I'm climbing around on as a part of some game or something. I'm hunting 100 people in some sort of Assassin-like game, where I have to find every single person on this mountain and tag them with this bone needle tied to my wrist. ","I'm climbing around and climbing around when about half way up, I find this deep, deep crack, about 20 feet long, 100 feet deep, and just wide enough for someone of my size to squeeze in it.","I start climbing down into it and at the bottom, I find a small tunnel which leads down to an open rift in the top of this buttress for all intents and purposes totally inaccessible except by the route which I followed.","I tag the two of them, thus completing my challenge, and now that the game is over, the whole mountain appears to become a public climbing area, with your usual assortment of 21st century climbers all over the place. ","As I'm climbing back out to the surface, I find Micah and his dad Richard in the first crack, near the bottom. Both are kind of stuck, so I help them out and we climb back up the crack to the surface.","After that, they go climb off in one direction and I in another, so I stop paying attention to where I am and just kind of climb around aimlessly. ","Someone says something to me about not climbing over the ropes and I see some green ropes cordoning off parts of the ground, but I don't really pay any attention and I keep traversing across this flat surface which turns out to be an aqueduct."," Before I know it, I'm 100 feet out over a river, climbing along these arches. I realize that if I continue, I have to climb one of the hardest parts in this climbing area to reach the other side of the river.",I just drop from the rock face and swim back to the docks where the green ropes I noticed earlier were. ,"After doing that, some park employee takes me to a warming hut and starts explaining stuff along the way, as well as warning me about some viruses and bacteria that have been known to reside in that river. ","At any rate, I turn out to be fine after some tests, and I go back to climbing shortly thereafter. Also oddly, on some places on the mountain there were traditional man-made hand holds and foot holds.","Somehow I run into this Native American professor, who I was absolutely convinced was magical.","Something about a by-product of gas, or something. Also something about a partner.","I'm snowboarding on some snow slope, and it's a really long snow slope, thousands of vertical feet, but it's so early in the season there's still patches of grass here and there. There are also some deep powder banks, and some fairly sweet jumps. ","I get in a single run, after which I meet my dad at the bottom of the mountain and we go off to this absurdly rich guy's house, apparently because he's hiring servants or something. ","When we get there, we're all asked to fire sniper rifles at a target dummy's head, and I slowly realize he wants an assassin, not a servant. ","My dad goes first, and does fairly well, but I go second and hit about a half inch off dead center. Nobody else who is there can get even close to that. ","I then sat down and had an interview with the guy, but I don't remember much about it. Also, something about the guy's mansion gave me an intense feeling of déjà vu, as if I'd been there in a previous dream.","I'm at some college up in the mountains, but I don't really know where. More specifically, I'm at one of the dorms a little ways from the main campus, across a river. The dorm is comprised of a series of Mongolian looking yurts.","This dorm, however, is sitting on the edge of a cliff with a balcony overhanging off the side. The cliff is high enough that the huge evergreens down below have canopies at about the same level as the balcony.","I look out and see these rather weak looking rope ladders leading up and down trees, from tree to tree, and really just kind of all over the place in the tops of this forest.","This cliff, however, is more of a ravine, and on the other side of the ravine is a steep mountain side. It appears as though the rope ladders lead to the other side of the ravine, and then up the mountain face. ","At the end of the string of rope ladders is one incredibly long one, several hundred feet in height, straight up this obelisk of a buttress on the mountain side. ","I mention these rope ladders to someone I'm sitting on the balcony with, and they mention that they lead up into this really unknown and dangerous mountain pass that leads over to this place called Yakima. ","Most of the people on the balcony apparently didn't believe that story at all, though, and said the whole thing was just some crazy guy's doing, and totally dangerous.","I'm in Ms. Koroch's room back at Lowell, only all the students there are Garfield High School students, and apparently Lowell just isn't an elementary school. I get up and leave.","As soon as I'm two steps out the door, though, Ms. Koroch sticks her head out the door and asks me what the hell I'm doing. I explain that I'm not actually a student in the class, because I don't go to Garfield anymore. ","She pulls out an attendance sheet, though, and sure enough, there I am on the list. I am totally dumbfounded by this, and try to explain to her that I dropped out last year, which while true in real life.","I argue with Ms. Koroch for a while, and eventually just get up and leave despite her yelling at me. When I get outside the building, I find myself at five corners, and go to the bus stop. I also feel like I was supposed to catch a flight.","I'm at home, in our dining room, and my mom and dad are hosting this guy, who seems to be old friends with my dad, but it also seems like they haven't seen each other in a really long time. He leaves really suddenly and unexpectedly.","M dad comments on how it's 3 in the afternoon, and thus seems early for a guy to be leaving like that. After he leaves, I realize that I have no idea who the guy was at all, nor could I remember a single thing about him.","I'm watching some movie in a school auditorium, in a building that in hindsight I think might have been Lowell, but it's hard to tell. ","It's like I'm back at Lowell though, as if we all had big communal sleepover at the school in third grade. Everyone is lying down all over the place, and there and blankets and pillows and futons set up everywhere.","Anyway, I end up cuddling with two girls, one of whom I can't remember and the other of which is Zoe. After the movie is done, we head back to our classes, where we're all sitting at desks, but apparently we don't have pre-assigned desks.","Zoe waves me over to sit by her, which I do, despite Andrew trying to get me to sit by him.","I'm at a highway junction stop, at some sort of restaurant or post office or something. I'm part of a group of 3 cars that is headed out to some small town over in Eastern Washington, but the turn off we're trying to make is the Cascade Highway.","The first car, containing Tucker, has already left the highway junction, and I'm in the second car of three as it's about to leave, and we have this big black dog in the backseat and this girl is driving who I don't remember much about. ","The car itself is a Saab, a fairly nice car, and I seem to remember that the girl driving isn't the owner of the car, but I don't know who is."," I feel like there's some important event that happened at that highway junction while we were there, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.","I'm preparing for the first day of class, but I woke up and started preparing for my day in my dream. I thought I had to get to a bus stop in Renton. ","Despite this, I ended up missing some bus that I thought was really important, but I figured out that it would be okay, I just needed catch some other bus, so I set some alarm, which when it went off, I couldn't turn off.","I am at some Garfield senior class event or something, and I'm participating in a drum ensemble with this other guy who is really cool, but I don't really remember much about him. He's kind of a mix between Caleb and Nick.","We're playing this song where we have a bunch of people lined up with things to read, and as each of them read their piece, which each seem to be verses in some long poem or something, we quietly drum a background beat to their speaking. "," It goes on for a while, and it's pretty cool, but eventually it kind of falls apart, and I go off and do other things. At some point I'm sitting at a table with Lily and a couple of other people our age, but mostly a bunch of freshmen. ","I'm casually sipping on beers, since there appears to be alcohol at this function, but one of the freshmen is simply going ham on the alcohol.","People are mixing drinks for him which are really fucking weird, like Bombay Sapphire and Heineken, and this little kid is just throwing them back. ","We kind of try to warn him that he's definitely not going to be okay in an hour, but he just kind of shrugs and continues drinking heavily. ","One of the older kids, who I think was Tracy, remarks that she is surprised that this freshmen is going more ham than me, to which I respond that I definitely could be going more ham than him in a different department.","Max David and I were at Micah's house, in the middle of some game that involved five dollar bills and strippers, though I don't remember much else. I do remember that the two of us hid in a closet for a while to avoid the other team.","I'm at Reed, this time as a student there, and I'm with Andrew at this really prestigious teacher's art class. I remember it being a 3 semester, 3.56 credit class, which didn't seem odd at all at the time. ","The class was really hard to get into, but apparently I got really lucky being near the top of the waitlist and I was automatically transferred in. ","The subject of the class was unclear, since there were other students there who were already part way through the course, and they were doing all kinds of things from drawing and painting to making stain glass windows, which I thought was awesome."," Also, there were a bunch of other sort of ritualistic things going on that made me think that the class was as much a class on spirituality as it was on art, though that seemed perfectly cool to me.","All I remember is playing a really, really long chess game against somebody. I played white, and I'm pretty sure I won in the end with a queen checkmate. I was at a college somewhere.",I'm dancing in a house of the future. The walls were probably the single handedly far most noticeable thing about this house. ,"The walls were all covered in screens that were simultaneously projecting kaleidoscope images that covered the walls, the ceilings, and the floors, as well as all the doors, cabinets, appliances, and everything. ","The thing was, they were all on a voice command, and whatever you needed would appear when called for, the counter, or toaster, or even whatever food you needed out of the refrigerator would just be there. ","I was dancing around in it, and I decided to go make food in the kitchen, and it was awesome, cause it felt like I was just using little floating objects in a house entirely otherwise made from kaleidoscope images.","I'm hanging out in my bedroom with Lily and Simon Berry. Lily asked me if anything was wrong. I just smiled at her, said nope.","I'm back down in Portland, at Reed, once again staying at the Woodbrige dorm, but things are different now. ","There's a couple extra bedrooms, one of which is now used as a pool room. I'm staying in one of the extra beds they have around, and kicking it with a bunch of people I haven't kicked it with in a really long time. ","I saw Nick and Nikki, and Sam, and a bunch of other people. Strangely, Micah, and Darin, and I think somebody else I know from Seattle were also there, though I only saw them in the context of smoking keef joints in one of the upstairs rooms. ","Later I'm in a car with Micah and Darin and these two girls, one of whom is Nikki and the other I don't really know. ","I'm playing youth soccer again, with a lot of the old team mates and Richard as the coach, but the field, the team we're playing against, and the league we're in are all distinctly weird. ","I start the first quarter on the sideline, and while everyone else on the sideline is shivering, I seem to be doing just fine in the cold, even without a jacket. ","We're playing on a field that seems to be perched on top of a really steep hill, and just a few feet from the edge of the playing area the ground just drops off, making the sidelines pretty thin. ","I'm stuck in some kind of parallel dimension or something, along with everyone I know and a lot of people I don't know. We're all stuck in this collective imagination land, where everything is really confusing and nothing really makes sense."," There's some sort of grand puzzle to the whole thing, though, and there's this one lady who's a doctor or something and she figures the whole thing out, thus freeing us from the prison of our own minds. ","It seems as though while thoroughly incapacitated by the dream like state, she still managed to ever so slowly get her limbs to move and create this weird 3 dimensional object which was apparently the solution to the whole problem."," After she frees herself from the dream prison, she takes the object and places it in the hands of others, where upon we are then freed from the dream prison"," After a little while, I run into Lily, who I remember seeing inside the dream prison, at which point I have some flashbacks to a scene of Lily at this beach park, but it's really confusing and doesn't make any sense. ","The two of us start to walk around to try and find other people we know, and eventually we find a large congregation of people on one of the rooftops having lunch, discussing the very odd predicament they all just escaped from.","The two of us sit down and start eating, at which point Lily turns to me and hugs me. We start talking about us and she offers to give me a ride to work after going somewhere with her, but she won't tell me where. ","At this point my memory gets kind of fuzzy, but we go off and do some stuff and eventually end up at the Subway where I work.","I haven't really been looking at a clock this whole time, but I think we're already a little late, on top of which Lily and I fall asleep in a chair, leaving Kore to work the front all by himself.","When I wake up, and realize I'm two hours into my shift, I scramble to put my uniform on and clock in, but Kore's already kind of pissed at me, which I found to be completely understandable. ","I worked for a bit while Lily slept in the chair in the office, but my shift seemed to go by really quickly and afterwards I left with Lily again and we went off into the night to have fun.",I'm in this giant warehouse which is essentially a jungle gym for paraplegics. ,"The whole place is set up with a ton of paraplegic activities, such as wheelchair basketball, hockey, water polo, and a whole bunch of other stuff, with everything just having the shit padded out of it.","The guy who runs the place was himself in a wheelchair, but his biceps were like tree trunks. There were a bunch of artificial intelligences and/or robots running around this place.","I'm climbing in a giant tree, quite possibly a Redwood, and the tree seems to go on forever and ever. I keep climbing and climbing and it never seems like I'm getting any closer to the top.","I;m climbing and I slip with one of my footholds, and my feet dangled below me for a few seconds while I held on for dear life with my arms, but I recovered from it and continued climbing without a problem.","I'm in a two-seater kayak with Lily, we're somewhere in the southern end of Lake Washington, only it appears as though Lake Washington is connected to another system of waterways that keeps going on and on towards somewhere or other. ","We're on the eastern shore, paddling south, and we increasingly lose track of where we are and keep getting distracted by little islands that we keep seeing and wanting to kick it on.","Lily mentions something about having to be back somewhere around Seattle Central, which is apparently where her car is, but from the far side of the water I can't recognize anything on the Seattle side of the lake. ","My recollection is that there was also some big long conversation involved in this dream, but I can't remember any of it or what it was about.","I'm at the airport with two other guys, one of whom is Fred Ness, the other guy I can't remember, but he's super familiar to me. ","My dad drops me off at the airport, and I get my ticket cleared and everything no problem, but my stomach almost drops out of me when I realize I didn't pack my computer for this trip which is for a major programming competition.","Fortunately, all three of us are there really early for some reason, so I convince this other guy to drive me back to my house to grab my computer, and we'll still be back in time for the flight.","Apparently, though, I slept with this guy's girlfriend at one point without realizing it, and so he was kind of bitter, but my apology was really sincere because I had no idea that that was a thing. It all worked out in the end.","I did have two big duffel bags filled with stuff, so obviously I was mildly prepared. Also, the ticket cost close to 5 thousand dollars round trip, so while I have no idea where we were going. ","I start out at the bus stop at NSCC, waiting for the 75 to take me home, only it's really late at night and something is fundamentally off about the whole situation, but I can't put my finger on exactly what. ","The bus comes and there's something really odd about the whole situation, but it's eluding me. I get home, and I think my house is relatively the same, except that it's currently under construction, despite the fact that were still living in it. ","Micah is coming over for dinner, and before dinner he and I go down to the park to smoke a bowl, but the park by my house is totally different, and much, much bigger than usual.","We're down by the water in the cover of some trees, smoking, and we start talking about his dad, who apparently he finally ate some brownies with, and apparently he had a lot of fun, and his dad also had a great time. ","By the time we got home, something was terribly wrong with me, and I can't remember what precipitated it, but I ended up curled up in a ball in the corner of my parents bedroom, rocking back and forth crying about something or other. ","I don't remember what it is that's upsetting me, but it's upsetting me pretty bad, because neither my mom nor Micah can seem to console me in any way. ","My mom is trying to convince me to eat, and that's not working, but Micah has the brilliant idea of putting on some rave music and pulling out these two long things, which can be best described as helical bungee cords covered in lights.","He starts playing with them, and eventually, it of course catches my attention, so he hands them to me and I start messing around with them, slowly at first, but faster and faster as the tempo of the beat gets faster and faster.","I'm whirling around the room in this crazy but awesome dance of a lightshow. Somehow it eventually ends with my head being completely wrapped in lights, and for a moment I felt like I touched God or something. ","I'm playing this really big, long chess game with Micah, and we're somewhere in the endgame, but there's just so many pieces on the board it's becoming ridiculous.","My pawn structure survived the whole game, and I end up in the end game with like 3 queens, but Micah almost pins my king with his queen because I just have too many pieces in the way and my king almost can't get away.","I finally get the one move advantage on him, and after that I just lead him through a series of checks which ends up being really long, because his king keeps squirming out of near mate situations.","Finally the triple queen situation just does his king in, and I finally pin him in the corner and get the last of my pawns out of the way so that my queens can mate him. Even in dream time, the game seemed to go on forever.","I'm hanging out with Micah and I think my dad on a dock at night, and my dad's showing me these other guys making repairs to the dock, because apparently conditions are really bad for the state of the dock currently. ","At some point we're walking along the dock, and we run into a straw-man looking scarecrow, that hops around on his pole similar to the scarecrow from Howl's Moving Castle. ","This scarecrow cannot talk either, but he keeps trying to lead me towards something in the town right by the dock. As I'm walking over there, some really odd things start happening, like a fire breaking out randomly in one of the shops.",All the animals go running full tilt down the beach away from the town. ,"At some point there's an attempted assassination, and suddenly there are troops everywhere and I start running for my life down the beach. ","I grab a couple of guns from some dead soldiers, and then figure that my best shot is in the water, not on the beach, so I dive into the water and start swimming around under the dock. ","I think my initial plan was to hijack a boat to get away, but the soldiers covered the docks by this point, so I just swam away underwater, down the beach to where I was hoping I could find a safe place to get out of the water.","As I swam down the beach, though, I eventually ran into some sort of rebel encampment on the beach, which is apparently what the soldiers were really after, as they thought I was one of the rebels. ","I eventually went around the camp and took a machine gun and a sniper rifle and got up in the cliffs behind the encampment, and when the two forces eventually clashed, I just sat up in my sniper nest and picked people off.","I'm in the upstairs of this really rich girl's house, and it looks a lot like Nap's bedroom, only in a multi-million dollar setting.","There are four or five other people in the room, including this really cool dude who seems like the most laid back guy in the world."," Several of us in the room, including the girl who's house it is, another girl who is apparently her best friend, and myself, are hanging out naked. ","There's a party that goes on all night, until eventually we all pass out in various places in this room. I think I just got too high to really remember anything about that night, but the following morning some more stuff happened. ","We all wake up more or less the way we fell asleep, and just kind of get up and start our day that way. ","Eventually it's decided that the group, of which there are now five or six of us total, is going to head down to this beach park nearby. I have my bike on me, so they all pile into a car and I bike on down there and meet up with them there. ","As we're hanging out down at the beach, this girl that I was really hitting it off with earlier appears to start really taking an interest in me, which is absolutely cool with me, because she's incredibly beautiful. ","Medium build, dark olive skin, beautiful black hair, soft brown eyes, like some kind of mix of Pacific islander and Greek goddess or something. ","After a while, it's clear that everyone is preparing to go their separate ways, so I head back to where I parked my bike, but this girl comes with me.","When we're out of sight of everyone, I turn around and before I can say anything she walks up to me and starts to give me a kiss. We spend a  solid five minutes or so making out right there, and it was awesome. ","Before she leaves, she tells me where her house is, and that I should meet her there in a half hour or so. I promptly get on my bike, and head off towards her house, feeling absolutely awesome about everything.","My dad and I are running a gas station somewhere out in the middle of nowhere, and for no apparent reason, Jay Leno stops by to do something or other at our gas station. In a bout of West Coast hospitality my dad gives Jay some free propane cans.","I'm walking back to the gas station, I somehow walk past William Deng's house, which isn't his actual house, but I clearly saw him inside doing something for his mom. ","I decided not to bother them and kept walking, but as I'm walking along I find on the ground an envelope, which among other things, contains thousands of dollars in random 100s, 50s, and 20s. I pocket it kind of suspiciously.","Harrison Ford but wasn't Harrison Ford comes into the gas station and buys something, but as he's headed back out to his car, I happen to be passing by him, when all of a sudden gunfire breaks out and he and I hit the deck.","Apparently this guy is trying to kill the Harrison Ford's character, but I didn't know that and my first instinct was to find cover, and the nearest cover happened to by the back of Harrison Ford's car. I jump in as he starts driving away.","At first he's trying to get me out, but then he gives up and decides his time is better spent trying to get away from the guy who's chasing us. An epic car chase ensues, in which a bunch of cops join in of course.","This ends with Harrison Ford crashing the car into the turnstiles of a subway entrance, and both of us hop out and make a break for this emergency exit door on the side of a building that we don't really know what is. ","Turns out it's a symphony hall, and Harrison Ford decides to try and make a break for somewhere else, but ends up getting caught.","Instead of doing that, I just find an open seat and sit down, looking down at my lap and trying not to attract anyone's attention. ","One of the cops, dressed as a plainclothes detective, comes in and starts looking around, but he doesn't see me, so he just sits down and starts watching the show, even though I know he's really surreptitiously looking for me."," I'm fumbling around with some stuff in my pocket and I find the envelope, which I take out of my pocket briefly to double check that it still had the contents I thought it had."," As luck would have it, Arthur from Inception was sitting  next to me on my right, and he quickly espied the money inside the envelope. He looks at me, looks at the money, and holds out his palm, clearly asking for money to keep quiet."," At first I gave him 40 dollars, but that didn't seem like enough for him, so I gave him an extra 100 on top of that.","The guy sitting to my left notices that and he bought it. Just when I think I'm going to get away from everything, I turn back to watch the show and the plainclothes detective is standing right in front of me.","I don't really remember where the textbook in my lap came from, but my first instinct was to just chuck this heavy textbook at his face, and then try and make a break for it, but then I realized there were several other cops.",I just gave up and put my hands up.," One of the other cops handcuffs me, but from the front, so I ridiculed him and he re-handcuffed me with my hands behind me. ","I think his handcuffs were pretty shitty, though, because they kept slipping off my hands, no matter how tight he tried to put them on. ","I realized it was because my hands were shaped in such a way that they could deform to be smaller than my wrist, so the handcuffs were useless. ","Realizing that I was caught and the attempt at escape was pointless by that point, I just told him to forget about it, and I would come with them, because I wasn't really trying to run away, so I just walked off with them.","I'm working at this pond, which is filled with the most disgustingly green water, in what is apparently some sort of crab processing operation. The thing is, these crab are absolutely huge, some of them a couple feet wide. ","Every single one in the pond is either dead or dying quick, though, with many of them missing limbs and other parts of their bodies. ","I'm standing on this little island in the middle of the pond with a couple other guys, and our job is to use these nets to fish out the main carapaces floating in the water, slice them in half, and then chuck them into a giant bucket. ",My dad and I are helping my brother pick out a new truck for himself. ,"The three trucks we brought back to the house were two different version of the Ram and a Hummer, which were apparently all made by Toyota. After some test driving, my brother eventually picks the more powerful Ram.","My family has moved into a new house, but it's like 6 or 7 stories tall, and we live almost all the time in the top few stories, and have no idea what'd down in the lower levels. ","At some point I got it into my head that there might be like a sarcophagus in the deepest levels of the basement or something, so I decided to go exploring. The previous owner died so all his stuff is still around."," After steeling myself a bit, I grab a flashlight and start descending into the gloom. Nigel starts following me, I guess out of curiosity, and together we find one staircase after the next."," When we get to what we think is the bottom level, I find an ancient computer still running down there, and when I get down there, there's a copy of GIMP 1.01 running on the screen. ","It looks like it's running Windows 95 or something, and I soon realize the computer is badly infected with a virus, and it's just randomly opening and closing different programs on the hard drive. ","My dad eventually just hard kills the machine to turn it off, but it's still really eerie down the basement. Something is off, but neither I nor my dad can figure out what. ","There's a couch, and some more nice furniture down in this lowest level, as well as a TV and a laundry machine and dryer. I soon discover that there's actually one more level underneath, but when I take a peek, I am almost floored by what I see. ","There doesn't appear to be much of anything in the lowest level except huge amounts of mold and fungus, all over the place. My dad is a little teed off, mostly because I think he thought he was going to have to fix it all."," My mom came down to have a look, she was totally disgusted. My first thought was of course ""kill it with fire"", and Nigel went running upstairs, as if to get as far away from it as possible. ","Emmett and I are busy pulling a heist on some rich guy's house. Emmett was wearing the most clowning big, black puffy Northface jacket, with  this super big hood that looked ridiculous. ","It's kind of hard to tell what exactly it was that we were taking, because at multiple points in the dream I remember us being in a warehouse, not in somebody's house. ","I remember a part where we hotwired a little electric scooter and hid in a bathroom for a while, which turned out to be a bad idea because the lock on the door didn't work correctly."," The upshot, however, is that we eventually got trapped in this upstairs room on like the third floor of this really nice house, and we run into Mariah Billey and her friend, whose father's house it was then apparent that we were robbing.","Instead of being angry she told us that the windows in that room were old, classic windows, and didn't have any laminate in them. ","After giving her a quick hug in thanks, Emmett and I jumped out the window, fell into a tree, fell out of the tree, and found ourselves on the Burke Gilman Trail, where upon, we booked it to the Ronald McDonald houses area.","Eventually, it ended up working out, but I don't remember having anything on me when we escaped, so I'm not entirely sure what the whole heist thing was about to begin with.","I'm hanging out on this sort of beach park a ways up north of where I live, and it's pretty late at night. It's kind of a cliff side, but there's some really nice beachfront down below, and it's not particularly hard to get down there.","I'm hanging out with Micah, Fred, Samma Wennerlind, Celia Gurney, and Greta Menke. Micah, Celia and I are all naked, I think for the purposes of skinny dipping, which we did.","We're sitting on some logs, talking about something or other, when suddenly I remember something I left back at my house, so I throw on my bike shoes, which I had with me in my backpack, but nothing else and started booking it back to my house.","I ran into one dude driving a truck, but he didn't seem to mind. ","By the time I got back to the park, which as I recall didn't take very long at all, everyone was back up at the top of the cliff except Micah and Samma, who were playing some game or something in the lake below.","I'm on a ferry or something with Emmett and Micah, we're doing something or other, there's something about 33%, and somehow we all end up back in Emmett's living room, which is this small little room with super comfortable couches and chairs. ","We're talking about something when this super hot girl comes in, whispers with Emmett for a second, and then Emmett looks at us and flicks his eyes up implying we should go up to the attic.","I'm in a room where they are demonstrating some sort of 3D camera technology in conjunction with strobe lights, and they're taking pictures of really odd necklaces in this really odd room, which is just covered in little reflective diodes. ","At one point, this girl sitting across the table from  me steals the camera and starts taking pictures of a whole bunch of random bullshit, for which she gets thrown out of the room, and the employees start giving me dirty looks.","I'm at least acting fairly normal, but eventually, I too crack and start playing around like a monkey inside this room, after which I voluntarily leave so they don't have to throw me out.","As I'm packing up my stuff in my backpack to leave, I apparently have my laptop and a Cintiq, which is awesome but I didn't get a chance to use it in the dream.  ","As I'm wandering around PAX, I see that a lot of the rooms have been converted into token-play rooms, similar to Gameworks, and I'm mildly disappointed by this. ","Eventually I reach a dead end with two bathrooms, and I have no idea where I am, so I backtrack until I find a staircase. ","As I walk up the staircase, suddenly I realize it's the staircase by my mom's old classroom, and I run into Micah and Jada Wittow on the staircase, who I talk to briefly before continuing towards what I now realize to be outside. ","As I'm walking through the main floor of Lowell, where apparently the basement level was holding PAX, the middle level is holding some sort of science fair centered around bananas, and there's yellow shit everywhere.","I vaguely recall at this point a conversation I had with my mom a while back about this banana science fair, and how she was talking to the principle about it and they both really liked it because kids seemed to really like bananas.","I realize I'm not going to be able to find my mom's car at all if it's covered in bright, banana yellow paint, so eventually I just decide fuck it and start walking from there. ","My recollection is that when the dream first started in PAX, it was at the Seattle Science Center, which while not being the state Convention Center where it's actually held, is a lot closer in terms of location.","Something about a ceramic bowl. I think I put water on it and it fell apart, but when the water evaporated, the bowl reformed in some sort of ionic reaction. All I remember is being amazed by self-reforming ceramics.","Tucker and I are outside my old house by Bryant Park, which is still the old house before the current owners made all the modifications to it. ","I don't remember how we came to the conclusion that this was a good idea, but we decided to break into the property just to look around and see what was inside. ","We did, and what we found inside had nothing to do with what the inside of the house actually looked like in real life, but it all looked vaguely familiar anyway and gave me a huge sense of déjà vu.","As we get towards the back of the house, we find this one door that looks really ominous and weird, and neither of us want to open it, but all of a sudden, Andrew's with us, and he calls both of our shit and just opens the door.","Behind which we find a garage with some old shit in it, which for some reason not only looks super familiar to me, but to Tucker to. ","After realizing that we're all actually committing the act of breaking and entering, we get out of there, lock up after ourselves so it appears that we didn't do anything, and then we all go to the grocery store to get some munchies."," It's about this time that Tucker at some point finds this ring, which looks like a plain old ring with a deep red gemstone set on top of it. This is apparently a ring of invisibility, though, because when he puts it on, he completely disappears."," Though it doesn't appear to have all the evil shit associated with the ring from The Lord of the Rings, never the less, after some fight breaks out Gandalf shows up and beats a couple dudes up who were trying to beat up Tucker. ",Although I say trying because the whole ring of invisibility thing was kind of foiling them.,"Anyway, after that Gandalf explains to us that we have to take this ring somewhere, and apparently Tucker has to hold the ring the entire time, but Andrew and I can go along with him regardless, so we do. ","We set out on this long journey on foot, a lot of which looks like the Burke Gilman Trail, until finally we get to this one extremely long straight part of the trail. Gandalf comes back and walks with us for a while, but disappears again randomly."," As we get to the end of this long straightaway, I start rounding the corner and have this feeling that I've seen this place before. ","All of a sudden it occurs to me that we might somehow be in Bremerton, and sure enough we get around the corner and we're in a beachfront park that is across the bay from Bremerton, and there are hundreds of battleships riding at anchor. ","There's this girl already there at the park practicing archery, who really wasn't important to the story in any way except the fact that her butt in spandex pants looks fucking amazing, and she was pretty memorable for that sole reason. ","Anyway, by this point the whole ring quest thing seems to have become unimportant, so we just kick it at this beach park and watch the sun set. ","As the sun is starting to go down, I think to take out my phone camera and attempt to take a panorama picture of the bay with all the battleships riding at anchor, but I just can't get my phone to work right.","I'm playing in part of a big football game between a bunch of people. I think it's the last in a series of games that have been getting bigger and bigger, because apparently people settled their arguments by playing games of football over them. ","Nick Faubion was initially playing as our quarterback, and he threw the first touchdown to me in the back corner of the end zone. I don't remember most of this dream.","I'm at a track and field event, spectating. The main event is this women's half mile or something like that, among which two of the contestants are the Knopp twins."," The only real competition seems to be between the two Knopp twins and these two Asian twins, since everyone else in the race seems to be absolutely terrible. During the race, the guy sitting next to me in the stands mutters something in Chinese.","He starts talking about Chinese nationality and being Chinese and stuff before I politely interrupt him to let him know that I am not the least bit Asian, that I'm half Mexican and half Polish. ","He is quite surprised to hear this, and asks how I know Chinese, at which point I tell him I know English, Spanish, Latin, Japanese, French, as well as some German, Russian, and Chinese.","When we get to Willamette, we meet up with Micah who is already there in the cafeteria, and we browse around for some food before the place closes down for the night, it being almost 10 o'clock. ","However, every single food dispensary in the cafeteria seems to be a donut shop, and the concept of pastries seems rather unappealing to me, so I take a pass. ","Shortly thereafter some school official or something kicks everyone out of the cafeteria, so we go back to Rachel's dorm room, after which Micah promptly passes out on the lower bunk. ","Rachel and I sit up on the upper bunk and talk about stuff for a while, until eventually she posits the idea of having a naked wrestling match, for no apparent reason. I quickly agree, and we both strip down and then begin to wrestle.","I'm at a rave being thrown at top of this skyscraper by Nick and some other people. The hotel room that I'm staying at is on the 97th floor, and the rave itself is on the 98th, 99th, and 101st floors for some reason. ","Also, this building is being used for a lot of other things, so as I'm walking around the building I keep running into seniors and restaurants and prostitutes and really odd stuff like that. ","I know I have a flight to catch later that day, so when I wake up in what I'm pretty sure is Nick's room, I pack up all my stuff and head over to the rave rooms, where the party is going like a rave normally goes in the middle of the day. ","I run into Zane and Harrison and Sam and some other people at the rave, but for some reason I'm looking for Nick, I think because I need something from him, so I go up to the 101st floor, which also happens to be a floor that only sort of exists.","Technically the building only has 100 floors, but on the 100th floor there is a ramp which leads up to this glass gazebo on top of the roof, and there I find Nick bumping away at the DJ booth, with a whole bunch of people gigging really hard. ","I remember that whatever time engagement I have, it's not for a while, so I just drop my stuff and dance for a while, in what seems like one of the most awesome rave rooms of all time. Although Black Lodge was pretty good.","I'm in some kind of arctic lodge, but I've got full nylon gear and boots and stuff on, and there's what I'm pretty sure is a trained polar bear, who apparently really likes metal things, particularly reflective stuff, like mirrors.","Someone shows him a mirror and he goes off running after it for a little ways, and then everyone starts throwing snowballs at him, some of which he just plucks out of the air and eats.","I feel like this dream is a continuation of another dream. I'm taken out by boat to this island, which is part of some rich mansion or estate or something. ","The mansion itself is more or less empty, but on the way in we notice several cave entrances in the side of the cliff, while we're walking around the inside of the mansion, we know there are secret passageways but we don't know where they are.","After a bit of searching, I accidentally find an extra room beneath the floor of one of the basement rooms, and this extra room has a staircase in it which leads down to a door. ","Presumably the cave system is on the other end of the door, but it looks scary as fuck, so I gather everyone who is in the exploration party, and together we open the door."," As it turns out, however, the door doesn't lead to the cave system, it just breaks the fabric of reality, and after that point absolutely nothing makes sense.","I'm hanging out with some fools down at the beach, including Tucker and some other guys I don't really know, but it's somewhere down by the water in downtown, and it's right before first light."," We're all standing around, when we see this dim triangle of lights hover through the night sky headed north along the far edge of Puget Sound, which both of us think is some military experiment or stealth plane. ","At this point, it's starting to be light out, and a fighter jet comes roaring up the Sound, booking it after the stealth plane, presumably. ","The fighter jet is followed by a series of other planes, including a giant bomber which is booking it so hard there are jets of flame coming out the back of its engines, more akin to rocket engines than jet turbines."," At this point, someone comes up to us and starts trying to tell us to leave, and I immediately don't like the situation,and start walking away as fast as I can without looking sketchy.","One dude stands his ground though and starts talking shit to the guy who walked up to us, who responds with the line ""do I look like a cop?"""," I am facing the other direction trying to get away, but I hear guns being pulled and more shit being talked, cause apparently the kid standing his ground wasn't buying that the other guy was secret service or whatever he was. ","After I'm a fair distance away, I hear a couple shots fired and at that point I just start booking it until I'm in downtown proper, by which time it's morning and there are morning crowds everywhere .",I just try to blend into the crowd and I figure I'll meet up with Tucker and the others at a later point in time. Out of the corner of my eye I notice a guy in what appears to be a TSA outfit following me around.,"When by chance I come across Eleazar, to whom the TSA-looking guy says hi, so I say hi to as well. As I walk off with Eleazar talking with him, he tells me that he knows the TSA-looking guy and sees him all the time.","Eleazar had a funny accent he doesn't have in real life, but I didn't really notice it. Also, the city in question wasn't expressly Seattle, since I didn't recognize any landmarks or anything, but it was similar enough.","I'm hanging out with someone I know, I think Emmett, at what I'm pretty sure is my neighbor's house, since it appears that my house is owned by someone else, who is, as it turns out, a crazy gun nut.","All I really remember is that Sam Perkins gets shot and dies, some other really weird shit happens, and it all ends with me smoking a joint in the middle of the street. ","I remember finding my knife at one point, which is only significant because I lost my knife in real life. Also I think there were some really big dogs involved somehow, but I don't remember how.","The only thing I remember is walking down some street with an electric guitar, I think a Fender like Micah's, which was plugged into a pair of headphones that I was wearing. ","I don't remember what it sounded like, but I do remember very specifically playing the fingerings for Wagon Wheel as I walked down the street. ","I'm part of some college tour or something, and somehow as a function of that I'm competing in some foot race/scavenger hunt sort of thing. ","The final checkpoint is inside what appears to be an abandoned dorm, which I quickly realize that although decommissioned by the school, is still used by students all the time. ","Everyone else involved in the tour kind of settle down in various rooms and chill, but I go to the very last room at the end of the hall on the top floor, to the room that's in the very upper corner of the building.","As I walk in, I am mildly shocked to see Andrew and Claire lying naked on a bed, as well as a couple other girls sitting naked. Andrew, perhaps in embarrassment, dips right quick, leaving me with these three girls in this room.","I'm on a road trip with Pat Yiu and Micah, somewhere that requires the Maple Valley Highway to get to, and we keep running into this car full of Korean pop kids, for lack of a better phrase.","We keep seeing them at gas stations and stuff, and we think they're really funny, but it's hard to say what exactly they think of us, and eventually we are forced into conversation by some absolutely ridiculous Korean pop song.","I'm in a dorm room near the UW somewhere, in what I have to assume is Fred's apartment, on one of the first few floors of the building. ","We're kicking it in his room, chilling, when we decide to go hang out with some other people in his building, so we go over to the elevator, and I could have sworn the elevator numbers went down, but we went physically up to like the 15th.","I talked with Molly for a bit, mostly about the fact that I hadn't been around much this summer, but then she had to leave, and shortly thereafter I woke up. Also, there was a small balcony out back.","I am at a house with Fred and Andrew, and we're all about to leave the house for the weekend. I am trying to settle some petty monetary transactions with Fred, and he's just trying to go. I think finally I just let the two of them go.","I go for a walk, at which point I run into some bicyclists who had some rather nice bikes that I was appreciative of. Also, there's something really strange about that house, but I can't quite put my finger on what.","So I'm hanging out with Roswell on his birthday, and at first, we're just kicking it at the park with some homies, Tucker, Nap, Emmett, and Caleb, as well as a few other fools who are cool. ","At some point we start driving somewhere, and when we're a little ways outside of town, we find a lake and we're walking along the lake shore as it gets dark when we run into a group of travelling bums that apparently Roswell knows.","They've got a campfire going, so we sit down with them and Roswell plays some harmonica, and more kicking it ensues. At one point, Roswell decides that he's had it with this hard lump he's sitting on top of, so he borrows a pickaxe.","After some careful fashioning, Roswell manages to turn himself into a birthday cup for himself, which was awesome.","I'm sitting in my physics class, and I get a whole bunch of work back from my teacher in a bit packet, and much to my dismay, my scores are hugely worse than I was expected, and out of a possible 325 points, I got like 30.","Being extremely angry about this but not wanting to show it, and I left the classroom and walked out to a football field, where I sat down and tried to calm down. ",I look across this field and see a small group of four or five friends sitting together on the bleachers.,"I'm sitting on a sort of futon or mattress that is set up on the deck of a house, with Micah and Ben. I think we're smoking bowls, at which point Micah goes inside the house and then goes downstairs to find a chess set.","He comes back with the chess set, but the pieces are all screwed up, for instance both black bishops are missing but there are 4 black rooks, which seems pretty useless to me. ","Regardless, Micah and Ben start playing a game of chess, which quickly falls apart because Micah is being absolutely silly with the pieces and randomly swapping pieces in and out of the game.","I think afterwards I biked home, though I'm not exactly sure where that was.","I'm down by the water about a block north of Matthew's Beach Park, at a house that belongs to someone I know, but I can't tell who. I'm kicking it with Caleb and Allen and a couple other black kids I don't recognize.","I'm with a group of people paddling around a lake, and I can't tell exactly what sort of water craft I'm sitting on, but it basically amounts to a surf board.","I'm on my own craft, but there are a bunch of different boats in the flotilla, and some of them are carrying multiple people. We all sort of funnel into this river, that eventually leads to something which I think is locks facility.","I'm on some sort of dock with Caleb, Sophie, and someone else I don't remember or recognize. For some reason or another, Caleb and this fourth person hop into a small zodiac sort of a boat take off presumably back in the direction of Seattle. ","Sophie hops into another boat and starts following them, and the only boat left is a considerably larger sailboat, with no outboard motor. Despite this, I jump in, and somehow almost instantaneously understand how to operate the sailboat.","Very shortly this develops into some sort of race, and we start weaving through a series of islands which I think are the islands of Puget Sound. Caleb's boat has the lead the entire time.","The channel in question leads us to a big open bay, which I immediately recognize as a YMCA camp. I initially thought it was Coleman, but after realizing that Coleman is on a closed off lagoon, I realized it had to be a different YMCA camp.","We ran the boats ashore and found a car, where all four of us decided to simply drive the rest of the way home, presumably since it seems to be getting dark. ","As we are driving home, we are taking some two lane highway out in the middle of nowhere when we pass a big open field somewhere out in the middle of the woods.","This field appears to be some military base or something, because there are two impossibly huge helicopters flying around the field. Both are the size of large buildings, in a shape that can best be described as a capital gamma.","They've both got 3 absolutely massive sets of rotors holding them aloft. As soon as I see them, I am overcome with a sense of déjà vu, not only as if I've seen these helicopters before, but as if I've been in this exact situation before."," Also out in this field are two very, very large tanks, again, more akin to moving buildings that mobile artillery. The thought occurs to me that these might be the military's first attempts at building mechs.","There's a girl, who I think is named Hayden, and she comes to sit down at a table with me and a few other people. We're in the middle of a flight, and four or five of us are sitting around a dinner table trying to figure something out.","The girl sitting down, however, apparently triggers some event which quite honestly seems to have already happened multiple times by that point, but a bunch of really strange characters attempt to break into the room. ","At some point I end up with a Scottish claymore, and I just start wreaking havoc on bitches left and right.","I'm on a flight out to some very small town out in the middle of apparently nowhere. I'm sitting in a very oddly placed seat in a very oddly put together airplane, and there appear to be a few other very similar aircraft headed the same way. "," After we got off the plane we were hustled away to this military bunker in a nearby mountainside, where it became apparent that we were supposed to be protecting the president from some terrible evil that was out and about. ","I think there was some sort of nuclear holocaust outside while we were inside the base, because as soon as we left the base and went out onto the main road, we all had to wear breathing apparatuses and Geiger counters. ","At some point while I'm walking down the main highway, I run into Nap just kind of strolling along with no equipment, so apparently there wasn't a bunch of radiation in the air or whatever.","I gave him my breathing bag but kept the air filter hose, which I'm not entirely sure how that was a good idea, but I did it regardless and kept moving down the highway. Eventually I pass Emmett at what appears to be a military checkpoint.","I find a railway which I begin to follow. As I follow the railway, though, I see a giant train coming a ways off down the track, so I find the nearest wall to make myself quite small against as the train goes by. ","The train comes closer, it quite apparently appears to be a military train with a giant cannon on top, and they apparently are on the other side of whatever conflict it is that we're fighting."," As this giant cannon starts raining shells on the couple of other guys who are there and me, we dip as fast as possible back to the military checkpoint where Emmett was. ","He points to a wall full of guns, from which I take down an M4 Carbine and check the safeties and latches and stuff. As soon as I've determined that the gun is good to go, I find a nice spot to hunker down and we wait to ambush the train.",I'm playing a game which amounts to soccer inside a gym with a hacky sack instead of a ball. ,"I'm goaltending for one of the teams, and most of my team seemed pretty terrible at the game, so I ended up saving a lot of shots on goal which was ridiculously hard because of the very small size of the hacky size.","Despite this difficulty, I managed to save all but a few shots, which was incredibly given the volume of shots the other team put on goal, because my team was apparently terrible. ","I'm part of a team of 3 that has infiltrated some sort of mansion complex or something, all armed with sniper rifles. The mission that we are on or whatever seems to be going rather well at the start.","Something goes terribly wrong, though, and the whole place turns into a giant blazing firefight, but eventually a helicopter comes and successfully extracts us from the situation. ","The fact that we quite apparently failed our mission doesn't seem to bother anyone, which leads me to believe there may not have been any mission to begin with. I","t may also have been that the target we were looking for simply wasn't there. Also, I remember wearing these skin-tight camouflaged combat suits that came straight out of some science fiction novel.","I'm at Reed for some sort of event, which seems very much like a con but isn't, and apparently Tiesto is there and playing a very, very small show. It's like 50 people and 2 songs long."," We have to sit around and wait while this lady reads from some bullshit book about something or other, but at one point Tiesto just comes out and talks to people and stuff. ","He mentions the Freaknight show that he's going to be performing at in a couple months, and talks about some music related stuff. Also, while I'm fairly certain the place was Reed College, it didn't look like it.","I'm at a clothing optional resort up in the mountains somewhere, and the biggest attraction to the whole place is a big lake where a lot of people go kayaking and fishing and such. ","I paddle around until I find this little island out in the middle of the lake which has some structures on it, sort of tower like things, and I climb up in them and start to admire the view surrounding. ","The far side of the lake is sheltered by a stand of beautiful old growth trees, and there are people at various points along the lake milling about. At one point I spot Micah and Lily paddling around somewhere on the lake.","At some point I end up talking to this random dude about cars and racing and stuff, and apparently the resort we are at is much bigger than just the lake, and he takes me a little ways down the way to a racing track that winds through the woods. ","I'm at a small gathering at Micah's house, which includes, among other people, Tim and Becca. Micah is trying to set up DDR pads in the other room over by the laundry machines, but I don't know that anyone ever ends up using them.","I'm in the midst of some sort of sci-fi role playing adventure, and I'm at this stage where I seem to have played through most of it already, but I missed one of the key central characters and I am going back and searching old, now derelict ships.","Amidst the ruins of one of these frigates I am ambushed by a series of robots, who are all talking about this ""savior"" of their race, or something along that line. ","As I walk down one hallway, a giant fighting platform dislodges itself from the wall at the end of the hallway and looks as though it is about to absolutely destroy me, when all of a sudden a much smaller robot comes up behind me and knocks out.","Out of the wall opposite me I see a suited arm and leg emerge. The small robot who knocked me into the alcove starts to say something to the figure coming out of the wall opposite me, but almost immediately is totally destroyed.","The next thing I see is the giant robot about to fire some massive weapon, and the suited character standing directly in front of it, right before he slides a knife perfectly into some joint on the robot and destroys the whole thing.","The man is apparently this character I've been looking for the whole time, and everyone simply calls him the Juggernaut. ","He is a semi-cyborg colonist who's entire colony was utterly destroyed by the machines, but he fought so well against the invasion that the robots apparently revered him as a god, strangely.","After talking with him for a bit, he decides to join up on my team, and we scuttle the ship and dip as quickly as possible. Also, I remember a lot of very circular motifs in the design of his armor, which was pretty damn cool.","I'm at some sort of shopping center somewhere, and I'm with a bunch of people I know, and I think we're all there for this blood donation drive thing that's going on, because a bunch of people are all filling up these plastic bags with blood.","There are elements of the whole thing that feel a lot like a field trip, but I don't think it was that, I think it was just some poorly run blood donation event. Among the strange cast of characters there are my brother and Lily.","I remember my brother helping me operate the plastic bag thing we are supposed to be filling up. I didn't have much trouble finding my own vein in my left wrist, but getting my blood from the needle into the bag was giving me huge problems.","Even after my brother helped me out with that bit, my blood came out like a biblical torrent, and only by some incredible luck did it not get absolutely everywhere. Afterwards I'm walking away towards somewhere with a few other people.","Other people peeled off and started heading other places, so eventually it was just Lily and I talking as we walked for quite some time. Also, I think the whole affair was somewhere in the vicinity of Ravenna Park.","I'm at Sophie's house, which is inexplicably very close to the water's edge on Lake Washington. Her family is also there, who consisted of her two parents and a little brother. ","I think in my dream I'm sleeping over there, and I wake up, and it's morning, so I decide to make breakfast. I remember there was a lot of kicking it out on the beach the previous night, but I don't remember much of it. ","Also, the house is laid out in this really odd way, not at all like it is actually laid out in real life. ","I start to make some delicious combination of eggs and tortilla and pear when Sophie comes down from upstairs wearing what basically amounts to some awesome fuzzy socks and a pair of boy shorts, and that's about it. ","A little later her family comes down and eats breakfast with us, and nobody really appears to be bothered by Sophie's outfit, so I decide to just let it roll and enjoy it. ","Sophie's little brother is really pretty funny in the way that most little kids are pretty funny, so I end up spending a lot of time playing around with him, which is all well and good."," A bit later Sophie's family leaves to go do something they were planning on doing with the day, leaving Sophie and I lounging about talking about stuff. ","For a long while the conversation stayed rather off topic, but eventually it wound up in a rather intimate session on the couch. ","I'm kicking it with Alec Martin and Tucker, and we are at one of the two's house but I can't really tell who's because the house doesn't really have any defining features. However, we're sitting around in a sort of living room.",The first mission we are playing is inside some sort of building with very nondescript architecture. ,"We are playing single player, but there are other Spartans fighting alongside us in the game, and we're going from room to room clearing out packs of jackals without much difficulty.","At some point we reach this sort of auditorium chamber sort of thing and there are two pairs of hunters waiting for us, but by this time I've found a sniper rifle and a bunch of ammo, so using my teammate Spartan as bait to distract the hunters.","I hand the controller off to someone else and kind of stop paying attention for a bit, but a little while later in what I have to assume is the next level, Alec, who is now playing, is flying this Covenant vehicle."," He tries to convince me that it's just a normal phantom, but it doesn't look anything like a phantom really, except that it's a blob in roughly the right shape and it's purple. ","After a couple more deaths it's my turn again on the controller, so I start flying this thing around, except by this point the mission is really unclear and none of us can figure out what to do.","There was this big ass tower off in the distance, and I felt like it was probably important, but we never went and investigated it.","I'm going to class on what seems like a more or less normal day when all of a sudden, a motorcyclist gets in a horrific automobile crash right outside my college. ","Without a second thought, I immediately stand up the bike in question, which turns out to be an absolutely sick Ducati, grab the rider's helmet, leave the dead guy on the pavement and ride away with the bike. ","Later, this somehow gets me involved with a bunch of shady deals with a bunch of shady characters, a lot of which involve some massive amounts of drugs and money. ","At one point I'm in a van, which is parked in the parking lot of some super store, and the guy who owns the van is busy counting money when all of a sudden he finds out that someone ripped him off for a bunch of money using counterfits. ","Becca keeps showing up in a lot of strange contexts and I keep running into her and then losing her again under the strangest of circumstances. Also, I'm pretty sure the Ducati's drive train gets fucked.","I am at what I understood at the time to be the opening act of Identity Festival, sitting in what is essentially a grandstand surrounding a main stage which is spewing some amazing music from someone.","This lady rolls up on us, writes something down on a post-it note, and slaps it down  on the table in front of the guy and then walks away. I look at the post-it note, and all it says is ""lettuce"" and then ""LETTUCE"" again in much bigger writing. ","I'm at work, and somebody who I didn't quite recognize, but I understood to be my manager let me off work early over something or other. ","I remember having a significant amount of computer trouble at the register, but I didn't really worry about it too much. As I move towards the back of the kitchen, I see Alex just lying down on the floor looking at the ceiling.","I noticed a bunch of animated gifs on the ceiling, which didn't make a whole lot of sense, but made the whole lying down on the floor in the middle of the kitchen thing quite a bit more sensible."," At some point I end up back home, not sure how, and I'm eating in my kitchen when I begin to see flashing lights playing over my shirt and the room I'm in. ","Initially, I can't locate the source of the flashing lights, but it quickly becomes apparent that they are coming from a cop car that has pulled up in front of my neighbor's house."," Apparently, instead of the college kids that currently live there the house has been converted into some kind of commune or shelter or something, and I notice the words ""Good food, Good ideas, Good vibes"" painted onto the wall."," As a second cop car is rolling up, the cop from the first car is carrying out a black cat from premises, and I see Mr. President casually strolling out of the house along with a few other people. ","No arrests are apparently made, so it may have just been the cops breaking up a noise complaint, although that wouldn't make any sense as far as the flashing lights were concerned.","I'm not really sure where I am, but I'm apparently in my own neighborhood, and I'm on the property of this extremely redneck family. I'm not sure entirely what I did wrong, but somehow I pissed off the father and his son.","My perspective shifts to somebody else who is I believe the neighbor of this redneck family, and while aware of my other body's location, is trying to slyly prevent his death. ","This all ends up in a rifling competition at night, where I am trading shot for shot killing crows with this redneck dude.","At some point, though, this plane comes screaming out of nowhere, executes a really sharp turn revealing four bright blue rectangular lights on the underside, and flies away. Seconds later, a series of really strange things happen.","At first, what seems like a really strong earthquake erupts, sending everybody scurrying for cover. Additionally, all electronics in the area like alarm clocks and phones seem to simultaneously short out. ","After the fact, I'm having a discussion with my brother about the airplane incident, and he apparently saw much the same thing I did, initially assuming it to be an SR-71 Blackbird as well.","The blue lights and the tightness of the turn completely rule out the Blackbird, though, and both of us know it. I walk down to the main intersection at Sand Point Way where people are gathering discussing what exactly it is that just happened.",The main consensus seems to be that it was some sort of sonic boom experiment by the government aimed at acceleration or catalyzing some geological process. ,"Very shortly afterwards military police and APCs start showing up, and people start getting questioned and hauled away, so I very quickly learn to keep my silence and not say anything untoward that might get me abducted. ","Also, I'm not really sure what ever ended up happening to my alternate body that was being hunted, aside from the fact that at one point I saw it climbing up into an evergreen somewhere near my house.","I am with Conrad, Allie, Becca, Fred, and a couple of other people that I don't really recognize. We're all out on a really nice boat, riding towards somewhere or other. Eventually after a series of shenanigans we arrive at a beach house. ","The guy seemed really cool, and we ended up kicking it for a while in this really nice beach house. We tried to figure out how to lock the boat up for a while before figuring out that all we really needed to do was take the key out of the ignition.","I am at some sort of prison for mages, or at least that is what it appears to be. For some reason I am allowed to talk to some of the prisoners, and as I talk to more and more of them, it becomes apparent that they are no real threat to society.","I appear to be the only one who knows any magic whatsoever, and all I apparently know amount to parlor tricks and flashy illusions."," Nonetheless, I end up sneaking around all over this prison, sending messages back and forth between the prisoners and generally helping out what little resistance movement there is. ","I'm arriving at some giant mansion type house , and I'm with who I am pretty sure are Fred, Becca, and a couple other people that I don't really know. ","We pull in through this garage that has this auto-detecting door, but once we get inside I very quickly figure out that the place isn't real by flipping a few light switches.","The whole situation segues into some sort of special ops mission where in I am on the team that is going to deploy by skydiving. We kind of mess the whole situation up somehow, and I think only one person lands where they are supposed to.","I am talking on the phone with Micah, and I invite him and the couple of people he's with to come over to kick it. It's about 8:30, and my parents are still up, but I figure they'll be in bed pretty soon, and we can just kick it in the basement. ","However, as soon as Micah shows up, he shows up with a full party-load of people, and I am really not prepared for it. Additionally, my parents are still up and socializing with these people, but it appears that they're being pretty cool.","Among the people who arrive is Alan Zeng, who offers me money for beer, and it doesn't really occur to me that I have no way to purchase said beer.","I'm living in some kind of dorm north of the UW, and I'm with a group of a few other people that have decided to go to someone's house somewhere a little ways off to the north of where we live, which happens to be up near Northgate.","It was really wet out, and I did a few little foot grinds on some tables only because the wetness made it pretty easy. At some point we all hop on our bikes and start going down this road that greatly resembles a country highway.","Me, Micah, and a couple of other people are walking along this sort of cliff top path nearby a public beach. We find a nice little secluded section of beach kind of away from everything else, and so we kick it and generally have a great time.","At some point the idea occurs to me to climb back up to the cliff top path, find a spot where I can make it to the water, and jump. The experience was halfway between skydiving and Olympic high diving. ","Everyone else that I'm with watches me do it and of course wants to do it as well, as it appears to be fun as hell and it is. At one point someone, though I can't remember who, kind of blows it and doesn't quite leap far enough.",There was some random dude with a bicycle up on the cliff top path.,"I'm part of some hunt for someone or something vaguely, but not necessarily human. It's hidden somewhere inside this sort of fort or palisade composed of stone and wood. ","My companions and I are searching along these sort of ramparts and catwalks, but the thing appears to have a lot of minions that keep giving us trouble. I spot the creature and make a really nice shot with my bow putting an arrow straight its head.","I am tasked with delivering a message to somewhere or other, so I get on a horse and ride off, but I keep getting ambushed by raiders and highwaymen.","Eventually I decide to just leave the road entirely and I ride through the wilderness, which turns out to not be very wild, as I keep running into settlements and farmhouses all over the place.","Also, I think at some point I find a river and try and follow that, but I think it just gets me more lost somehow.","I'm moving through an airport security terminal with my family, and we are all being checked for tickets and such, but when the security lady checks my ticket, the barcode registers an error. ","At first the employees start to give me all kinds of trouble, but apparently the solution to the whole problem is that I sign a couple of things and they give me a new ticket and I get through security just find.","I'm staying in a hotel somewhere with my family, and by the time we get there, everyone is really tired, so everyone just goes to bed really early and tries to go to sleep. ","At some point, however, these two security guards or police officers, I can't tell which, come into the room, turning on the lights, and start looking for shit, which is extremely disruptive to say the least. ","In the end, absolutely nothing came of it, and I have a feeling these two guys were just being dicks for no good reason. ","I'm hanging out with someone famous, I think White-Ra, and I remember giving them a big hug around their midriff for no good reason other than that I could.","I'm on some sort of nature hike somewhere that I don't recognize, though I assume it was somewhere in Washington state since I remember Mt. Rainier in the background."," One guy, who appeared to be the leader of the group in some way, was talking to another of the kids in some South American accent of Spanish, so I joined in their conversation, slightly to their surprise at first, I think.","Some tour group of old people showed up and we started taking pictures in front of the mountain and stuff. Also, I don't think I've ever had such a flawless accent in real life.","I'm in the passenger seat of a boat car, which apparently belongs to Zora, since she's the one driving me around. ","I think she is driving me home, since we're trying to find a boat launch were we can get back onto land, but my memory kind of fails me as to where all the boat launches in my neighborhood are, so we end up getting a little lost. ","We make it back to a house that I seem to recognize as mine, despite having no similarities to my actual house, where apparently I live up in a tree house sort of deal that I have to climb up into. It's a bit cramped for space, but it's nice.","I'm scrolling around in what I can only assume to be Google Maps, looking at islands along the shoreline of Lake Washington in what I initially assumed to be the rich neighborhood around Laurelhurst. ","I switched the map view over to satellite imaging, and zoomed in closer and closer on an odd little object until I realized that the object in question was a tree stump, and I was no longer looking at it as if I were a satellite, but as a person. ","As I found myself on this island, apparently named Business Island, I started to walk around through an area that was quite similar to the Center for Urban Horticulture.","Eventually I came by a small stream that was a little too wide for me to cross without getting my feet wet, so I followed it for a while until it narrowed a bit further upstream. ","However, as I followed the stream further and further up, I eventually found myself in Matthew's Beach park, and, pleasantly surprised by this, simply walked home. ","I'm coming back from some vacation somewhere, and apparently the meet-up spot back in Seattle for all the different cars coming back is this bookstore that quite possibly might have been a library down by the Ave."," My dad, in what I assume was the first car back, dropped off a bike, with which I was going to bike the rest of the way home, and then left. ","I then waited around a little bit until Micah's car showed up, so I could give some stuff back to him before I left back for home. When he showed up, we sat around talking for a bit, and while we were kicking it, Zach and Amanda both.","The four of us struck up a conversation about the vacation we were just on, old times, and the usual gambit of conversational items. After that, we all kind of went on our way, and I had a great bike ride home.","I suddenly wake up in my family's Subaru, parked across the street from where we live. I look out the window, and see two massive orbs hanging in the sky. ","It takes me a minute to realize that it is a celestial event, which at the time I assume to be the lunar transit of Venus (which is physically impossible in the real world). ","As I get out of the car to look at it more clearly, I then notice for the first time that it has recently snowed, and everything is covered in a white blanket several inches thick. ","I'm living in a community full of children, in an idyllic little haven kind of detached from the rest of the world, seemingly somewhat similar to Matthew's Beach. ","There is only one adult there, a beautiful young woman we all refer to as ""Mother"" despite there being no way that she was actually the mother of any of us. ","Every time we asked her where all the other adults were, she always told us they lived on top of the mountain, referring to a single giant mountain that sort of towered above everything. ","None of us ever left the little hamlet, even though we were all given free rein to do as we pleased within the confines of the community. One day, however, I wake up inside a prison, completely confused and disoriented. ","The prison is run entirely by adults, and they all seem to serve a single king or god, as they describe him. They explain to me that as a child I was allowed to live as I chose, but now that I am an adult, I must serve this entity as well.","As a result, I am put through a battery of indoctrination and psychological torture techniques in an attempt to get me to conform, but I continue to refuse. As time goes on, I learn of a resistance movement of other young adults such as myself.","Because of the nature of the prison, this is the first time that many of us have seen each other, and I meet this girl so beautiful, I could not believe my eyes. ","The plan was to all break up into small groups and rendezvous at the train station as the train is coming in, then use the momentary opening in outer defenses of the prison to make our escape. T","he girl and I make our way to the train station, and all goes fairly well, until just before the train arrives we are ambushed on the train platform by a bunch of prison guards, all well armed with guns and machetes.","It takes me but a split second to realize that it's a trap, and the whole thing is set up to kill all those who refused to submit to the indoctrination. ","I see the ringleader of our group making a break for it out one of the windows, with a small group of prisoners with him. ","Skirting the edges of the slaughter and trying not to be noticed, the two of us make our way to the window that the ringleader went out, hoping to make it out before everyone on the train platform was dead. ","I realized with an instant sickening feeling that he too was one of the indoctrinated, hiding himself amongst our ranks to sniff more of us out. ","Already half way down the rope line and with this girl hanging on to my shoulders, I made a split second decision and started swinging on the rope. ","It was at this point that I got the first real look at where we actually were, and to my surprise, we were in fact being held prisoner in a fortress that was indeed at the very peak of the mountain. ","I also realized that there were no train tracks leading into the fortress, and the whole train and platform were in and of themselves were completely fake. ","Swinging along the line, I realized our only hope of freedom was to run along the wall and swing to the very extent of the rope, then if we let go it would hopefully send us over the outer wall into a snow bank. ","Figuring it was our only shot we gave it a go, and clutching this girl tightly, we plummeted the hundred feet or so over the edge of the outer wall and landed as intended in a giant snow drift, unharmed."," Figuring they would be after us quite soon, we fashioned a makeshift sled out of some nearby wood planks and took off careening down the mountain. ","As we travelled further and further down the mountain, I began to recognize our surroundings and realized that we were not too far from the hamlet where I had grown up. We made our way towards the hamlet in the hopes of finding some escape there.","When we got there, I immediately noticed that much of the place was covered in snow, indicating that I had actually been imprisoned for quite some time, long enough at least for the seasons to change. ","All the children were initially quite scared to see us, and when Mother came out and saw us, she almost fainted. Mother led us to a small shack where we did our best to hide, but it wasn't long before the indoctrinated showed up in SUVs. ","From our hiding spot, we could see all the children of the hamlet hiding in whatever spot they thought best, obviously scared to death. The indoctrinated began to question Mother about our whereabouts, and clearly weren't buying her lies at all.","Apparently fed up with her, one man pulled out a pistol and shot her in the face point blank. The indoctrinated then began to search the shack where we were hiding, and before long found us and began dragging us outside."," In the midst of the resulting struggle, I managed to kick over a small wood fire stove, spilling embers all over the place. The shack was apparently a tinderbox, and in moments the whole thing was up in flames. ","Using the momentary distraction, I grabbed a gun from one of the indoctrinated and shot three of them. ","The remaining couple of indoctrinated that weren't dead or on fire quickly tackled me, and we wrestled briefly until the girl found a two by four and knocked them out from behind.","Seeing all the terrified little children still cowering in their hiding places, we urged them all to make a break for it and run. As we made it to the edge of the forest, I turned to watch the entire hamlet up in flames. ","We shared a quick kiss, and then escaped into the woods together.","I go by a house which I understand to be Micah's house, and he's there baking biscuits with honey which are absolutely delicious."," After making a whole bunch of them, the two of us pile into his van, along with Tucker and I think also Caleb, and we start driving off towards somewhere or other."," At one point Becca calls Tucker about some money that he apparently owes her, but Tucker just doesn't even feel like dealing with it right then. ","After driving around for a while we eventually end up at an apartment in some high rise complex overlooking some section of city I don't recognize at all. There's a bunch of people just kind of there chilling, among them Natalie Portman. ","At one point she seems to have a nervous breakdown of sorts, and I asked her if she considers herself burdened by the near universal recognition of her face. She tells me that it's been like that for her for as long as she can remember.","Long before she was recognized by people, but I explain that universality of her face is something that runs much deeper than any one person's recognition of her person, citing her similarities to Audrey Hepburn.","Later on at this party, she hands me to pieces of paper folded up with each other, one is a letter to me, of sorts, more of a small note, and on the other she wrote just a single word, ""nuclear"", in somewhat excessively elaborate script.",I'm part of some smuggling ring operating in and around a lake that is very similar to and just might be Lake Washington. I'm standing with Micah in the front yard of some very rich waterfront house.,"The house belongs to this Mexican family who are apparently related to one of the members of our smuggling ring, since they're on their front long having a picnic and don't seem to mind us at all.","As I'm standing there with Micah, scanning the skies with a pair of binoculars, I spot two planes speeding up along the lake, one in hot pursuit of the other. ","The leading plane I recognize instantly as our smuggling plane, being piloted by Andrew, the other I immediately realize is some kind of law enforcement chasing him. After some impressive air acrobatics, Andrew manages to lose his tail.","Around this hill on the far side of the lake, and as soon as the chasing plane has flown away a little ways, he comes speeding in and neatly lands the plane in the water just in front of this house. ","Micah and I immediately help him disassemble the plane by taking the wings off, and storing the whole thing in the garage of the house.","We spot the second plane coming around the lake for a second pass, and manage to get the body of the plane into the garage just in time to ensure it wouldn't be spotted, apparently resulting in great success for the mission as a whole.","I'm at a some church congregation for some function that my mother wants me to go to, despite my misgivings. I brought along a gameboy and copy of Pokémon yellow to keep myself entertained, which I stashed in my pocket.","Upon arriving at the congregation, I ran into Micah's parents, which should have struck me as odd, seeing as how they are Jewish, but regardless I talked with them for a little while before things were going to get started. ","Apparently Miley Cyrus was supposed to be some sort of motivational speaker for the day, which made me insanely glad that I had brought along my gameboy, I slipped the thing out of my pocket and booted it up.","To my dismay, however, it began to emit rather loud game noises, and no amount of my fiddling with the volume dial was able to do anything to stem the tirade. ","I then took out the batteries of the gameboy and it was still ceaselessly making noise, a fact which I tried to demonstrate to people despite no one really listening to me and just being generally pissed off at me. ","I volunteered to just go outside with my ceaseless noise-making device, at which point Miley came over and started a screaming tirade about how I couldn't miss out on the pledge of allegiance that was to be said at the start of the event.","I immediately rejected this idea, I wasn't about to simply hand over my property, and despite my initial attempts to be reasonable, it quickly blew out of proportion to the point that there were handlers with firearms threatening me.","I'm not really quite sure how the situation eventually resolved itself other than the fact that some point I just up and left, gameboy and all, with a lot of people cursing me to hell and whatnot on the way out.","At that point, I just walked a few blocks away to a nearby park, and sat down to play some good old Pokémon yellow. Also, my mom called me after the congregation was over, and was really pissed off, unsurprisingly.","It's Friday in some high school class similar to what I expect would be one from Garfield, only apparently smoking weed in class is legal, because at the beginning of class this dude lights up a joint and passes it around. ","Friday's are also apparently test day in this class, so maybe the teacher tolerated it because we got better scores that way or something like that. The test itself I think was some kind of geometry or similar math subject.","I'm watching the story of this Asian woman who either accidentally or in self-defense, I can't quite tell which, shoots and kills a gas station employee.","The setting is very similar to the playfields by Five Corners, only the place is completely overgrown with reeds and there's a river running through the place. ","The gas station is owned by this gang of thugs that are really pissed off and start coming after her. Two thugs are sent into the field and eventually find her lying amongst the reeds, but she manages to fight them off and escapes once again.","The dream fast forwards a couple of years or so, and the woman is now in hiding in some house, looking and acting completely different now. Three thugs from the gang, two men and one woman, have apparently tracked her down to this house.","Attempting to keep them busy, the woman makes them food and answers all their questions as innocently as possible, keeping the guise up as long as possible.","Eventually the two men see a guitar and ask to play, while the female thug asks to use the restroom, which is upstairs. The two men sing a long, beautiful song about the sad tale of their friend being shot.","A woman manages to keep her cool and sway with the music, shedding a couple of tears where appropriate because of the beauty of the song being played, which is indeed being played quite well. ","As the song comes to a close, it looks as if the three thugs are going to leave, and the woman would finally be free, until the female reveals that she hadn't gone to the bathroom at all. ",I think it was because the gas station employee who was originally shot by the woman was a member of this gang of thugs and was in some way or another trying to abuse the woman before she shot him.,"I'm in the Lowell Gym with about a dozen other kids my age, including Nathan and a few younger kids I don't recognize at all. It's some sort of pick your activity for the day kind of day, and this girl and I are sort of playing dodgeball.","At some point a phone starts ringing, which despite being my phone, Nathan picks up and answers. As it turns out, it's some guy I had a job interview with recently being really bitter because apparently I lied to him about something or other.","I can't really hear him too well, so I take a step outside the gym. It's only when I'm outside the gym that I realize that I don't have any clothing on, which only struck me as a potential problem because of a bunch cops running around.","However, it quickly becomes apparent that the cops are quite preoccupied with something else, and before I know it a bell rings and there's people everywhere anyway. Not really sure what, if anything, ever really became of it. ","Also, there was some teacher like character trying to tell us something or other about physical fitness, but I don't think anyone was listening because no one really cared.",I'm travelling with my family to some sort of remote small town out in the middle of nowhere.  ,"We're staying with the Perkins family, who apparently own a pretty nice house on one end of this town, quite close by to the ""old town"" brewery that seems to be a fixture of public life in the town. ","Most of the other residential areas of the town are on the other end of the main drag, and the whole town seems to be situated on a spit of land jutting out into a sort of dog leg shaped lake. ","For some reason or another I'm spending a bunch of my time riding around town on a bike helping people out with little problems, helping out little old ladies and such. One of these odd jobs was to fashion a bike rack out of some metal piping.","In the course of doing these really odd jobs, I run into a fair assortment of really strange people including a couple of teenage girls who worked in a restaurant and some Mexican day-laborer types who I could not figure out why they were there.","The Perkins family apparently had a hook-up with the local brewery, and my dad and brother spent a lot of time sampling beers and ciders from their house stock, and while I was staying there I kept finding all this crazy shit inside their house.","I'm on vacation with my family out in the Himalayas somewhere, and my brother has cooked up a plan with my dad to climb Annapurna. The whole climb is dangerous, not just from the cold and ice but also from a huge amount of rock fall that goes on. ","Despite all of this, there are apparently several tea houses set up along the route, and we end up staying at a couple of them during inclement weather. The climbing itself is rather straightforward, done in two rope teams of the three people.","The other members of the climbing party include my brother, father, cousin, and uncle, and there is one other person on the front of my rope team who I can't remember who is, except that he's Asian and small.","We passed a fair number of other climbing parties on the mountain, suggesting that despite the mountain's difficulty and altitude, there were still a lot of people trying to make the climb.","I'm in a city in Brazil, I think Rio de Janeiro, on vacation with family. As I remembered it at the time, we had spent a few days somewhere else in Brazil up in the mountains, doing some snowboarding.","I wake up real late in the afternoon in a hotel room on the 4th or 5th floor of a building on top of a hill, looking out over the city. From that vantage point, the city looks almost not like a city at all, but an ant hill.","The rest of my family is out doing something, so I decide to leave the hotel room and take a walk. As I'm walking down the main street that this hotel is situated on, I come to a sort of pedestrian intersection where two major walkways converge.","The one that I wasn't on leads down the hill as part of this wide, grassy lane with a lot of people just sort of milling about. Here I run into my mom, who seems to be gardening for absolutely no apparent reason whatsoever.","As I look out over the city from this vantage point, I am looking at a completely different city, as at the bottom of the hill is a massive oil refinery and industrial district, built upon a delta of waterways.","The air is thick with smog visible in the upper atmosphere as the waning sunlight comes into contact with it, and the city is much more recognizable as a modern industrial city.","I start to walk back towards the hotel, this time going around the other side of the building. I come to a staircase leading up into the hotel area that initially I thought was blocked off for some reason.","I just couldn't read the writing on the sign and it turns out it was totally unrelated to the accessibility of that staircase, I found myself by the dining hall of the hotel, where I caught my brother and father sitting out of the corner of my eye.","I went down to join them and found myself a tomato, which I began to eat as I woke up. Also, there was a moment where I realized that I must have looked pretty silly not taking the stairs because of a sign that didn't say anything at all.","I'm on vacation with my family, staying in some sort of cabin or something out on the outskirts of what is already a really small town to begin with. ","The main part of the dream I remember is cleaning up the house as we're about to leave, making sure we are leaving it as nice and orderly as we found it. ","I remember the car being jam-packed full of stuff on the way back, and I remember riding in the backseat as we drove down the highway on our way back home.","I'm watching in third person as a woman leaves her job, late at night, and walks back to her car in an otherwise mostly empty parking lot.","As she opens the car door to sit down in the driver's seat, a hooded man starts to approach the car. In a mixture of fear and quick thinking, she slams the door shut and locks the door just as the guy pulls a gun. ","Apparently, the woman also keeps a pistol in her purse, and as she pulls it out the man fires one shot through the window,  I think to break the window more than to kill her, since the bullet lands in the seat between her legs.","In response, she fires three shots directly into the man's chest, killing him. The woman then drives around a little bit until she finds a cop and reports the crime and self-defense to him.","I'm out on Lake Washington in a rowboat with couple of friends, including Micah and a couple other people I don't remember. It's a sunny day, and we're spending the day paddling around, swimming, and just generally having a good time of it.",Later in the day we moor ourselves up near a pier and spend a little while sunning ourselves and drying off before we go ashore. ,"All of a sudden, this plainclothes guy in a small little boat with an outboard motor comes up to us and tells us to follow him to shore immediately, which we comply with."," Afterwards the guy starts asking us for identification and stuff, and which point I decide to challenge his authority because we still have absolutely no idea who this guy is. ","He pulls out a badge revealing himself to be a cop, and tells us that apparently boats aren't allowed to be moored in that area after a certain time, and it was like 15 minutes after that time.","After some further discussion regarding the situation we manage to resolve things amicably, but my friends and I still left the area somewhat confused by the whole thing. ","Also, apparently the rule is just against moored boats, and as long as the boat is travelling towards somewhere it was completely okay for boats to be in that area at that time, which made no sense to me.","I am at some sort of convention. I originally ended up there to play Starcraft with some guys I don't really know, but at different points the convention also seemed to be themed around Pokémon, basketball, and even a Christian religious group."," At the basketball courts, everyone seemed to be a really big fan of the LA Lakers, as there was some major NBA event going on involving them, and everyone seemed really excited whenever they did well. ","At some point during the basketball games I ended up with some other guy's state ID card, though I was able to get it back to him and ended up having a pretty cool conversation with him. ","Later, after the convention seemed to be over, I was walking somewhere, possibly home, and ran into Kathy Hodges, who was looking to play the Pokémon card game at the convention, but apparently missed it. ","Also, at one point in the dream seemingly disconnected from the rest of the events, I visited my mom at somebody's house apparently going physical therapy for being partial paralyzed, though she seemed to be doing great when I saw her. ","I'm down at Reed for Renn Fayre, only Reed is quite a bit different than it usually is. For one thing, it's sort of out in the woods somewhere and not in the middle of the city like it actually is. ","For another, a lot of the buildings are missing, and all in all, it's a very different setting than the actual setting of Reed, but I still understand it to be Reed at the time. ","There is the usual partying going on with a wide range of individuals some of which actually go to Reed and many of which do not, but are there none the less. Despite the festivities going on around me, I'm having a pretty low-key time.","At one point we're all sitting outside on a grassy hill, and I urge everyone to be very quiet and listen to the wind rustling through the trees, an absolutely beautiful sound as I hear it. ","On the last day that I'm going to be there, a friend of mine takes me aside and asks me whats up with me, since hes I've been pretty low-key the whole weekend, and I explain to him I ""needed the silence in my life, and it has been beautiful"".","I'm living out in some sort of country farm house with my family, and I'm talking to one of our new neighbors about this fancy half barn, half steampunk garage type building that he built next to his house, which is a solar farm of sorts.","I am collecting power through a series of solar panels that are blended very well into the rest of the structure. Said neighbor reminds me a lot of my uncle Ed, only much nicer and more shy, which is a strange contrast. ","My mom made some eggs, which were delicious.","I'm back in what I have to assume is the equivalent of middle school, though in many ways it much more closely resembles a college than a middle school. ","The only thing that makes me really think it was a middle school is the fact that at one point I ran into Mr. Knatt, and there appeared to be a bell schedule dividing the day up into class periods.","At one point I'm walking along a path that goes around the sports fields, and I'm watching a bunch of people play soccer, only to realize that Micah is playing goalie like he usually does. Later I'm walking around a sort of plaza area.","While I seem to realize that I am dreaming, and after several failed attempts to conjure up people I know, ran into Lily and had a pleasant conversation with her for a while.","Later on I'm walking round with Peyton and he mentions a subterranean section of the school, which I don't really believe exists, until he leads me down there. ","In many ways it's a really creepy area of the school, as there are very few ways down there, and once down there, there are a lot of locked doors, some of which apparently lead further down into the complex. ","However, after a while walking around in these underground tunnels, we eventually come a sort of cafe or reading room, which apparently acts as a sort of quite place where students can come and study in quiet, detached from the rest of campus.","Peyton buys me a raspberry scone, which turned out to be absolutely delicious, and we found a nice quiet corner and talked about stuff for a while.","Also at one point I remember walking past a giant sort of auditorium, and there was some sort of play being put on by the Japanese club.","I am sitting in a classroom that is on the bottom floor of Lowell, only the place seems to be some sort of religious school with everybody in uniforms and mandatory prayer and so on. ","I'm sitting close by Lily Hansen, who I am talking to about what's been going on in class, and apparently it's the third or fourth day of school but I can't seem to remember anything about being in that class at any point prior.","As I'm getting close to the exit, I start to get really heavily disoriented because where I thought there should be a small boy's bathroom there is instead a room for ""retarded children"", according to the sign on the door.","It appears to be some sort of detention room, and the door next to it marked as a bathroom is in fact a girl's bathroom, which I only figure out after seeing Elizabeth Anne walking out of it. ","On the other side of the hallway is a door marked as a boy's bathroom, but that appears to actually be a cafeteria of some sort, and for a few minutes I am completely confused as to how to exit the building, but eventually I figure it out.","I'm pretty sure everyone in my classroom was a little shocked to see me just up and leave, but I don't think anyone tried to follow me or stop me in any way. ","I am working in some sort of Asian fast food deli of some sort, making what I can only describe as chicken fried in a combination of tomato sauce and butter, and then wrapped in bread dough and baked. ","An old lady berates me for doing it incorrectly, and throws in something in the order of a few extra pounds of butter. This seems more than a little unnecessary to me, but apparently is the way this dish is prepared, so I just go along with it. ","In an unrelated section of the dream, I am helping out some old folks in a retirement home and at one point walk into a kitchen that seems eerily familiar to the kitchen of one of my childhood homes, but in reality isn't that similar all.","I'm staying for a couple of days at what I understand to be William Deng's house, despite the fact that it bears no resemblance whatsoever to William's actual house.","The house is really strange in that there are entire sections of the house that I simply didn't notice upon first glance, merely because many of the passageways connecting the different sections of the house are hidden from view. ","For instance, in one of the bedrooms there is a door beneath one of the floor rugs that leads to a small sort of staircase leading down to the basement area. ","As it later turned out there were in fact other ways to get down to the basement, but that still seemed like a really odd place for such a passageway to be. ","Shortly before waking up, I am extremely thirsty and my throat is parched, and a series of unrelated scenes go by in which I attempt to drink water and it never helps. ","At first I am talking to Becca's sister Amanda, who I have never met before, then a little while later I am helping my parents out in the backyard but everything is slightly different and messed up.",Finally I'm in a hotel room watching what I think are Valentine's day advertisements on TV. Throughout these events I am repeatedly trying to drink water and either failing or not understanding why my thirst is not being slaked. ,"The campus, once again, looked absolutely nothing like the actual campus, with a bunch of Hellenic architecture buried into a hillside on one side of campus, and a thickly wooded area on the other side of campus.","Strangely enough, as I'm biking through the campus on my own, I manage to catch a glimpse of what appears to be gang warfare going on, though I didn't immediately pick up on anything at the time except that some people were acting really sketchy. ","Later I'm down by some basketball courts and I meet up with Micah and Lily, and rumors start going around that a bomb went off somewhere on campus, which I immediately knew was the work of the guys I had seen earlier.","Lily, by far the most prepared of the three of us, had a book filled with bus and train schedules, and the three of us took off that afternoon for whatever our next destination was.","I'm in a field nearby the University of Washington, with a few friends playing frisbee in the nude near dusk. I think Fred is one of the people I'm playing with, along with a couple girls I don't really recognize. ","The field is next to this little creek, and at one point a mother comes along with her two children and they play along the side of the creek, apparently not really noticing or caring about us. ","As the sun continues to go down, the field lights come on and so we continue to play frisbee into the dark. ","At one point the frisbee flies rather close by this family, and I run and go catch it, but overhear the mother muttering something about us. ","I ended up having a conversation with her about social nudity and its acceptability in modern society, and then went back to playing frisbee with my friends.","I'm climbing a mountain, which at the time I remember to be Mt. Rainier, with my dad and someone else I don't remember. My dad and I are roped up, preventing me from doing something, but I can't remember what. ","My ice axes are incredibly ill-suited to the task at hand, but the slop doesn't seem to be that steep at all. In hindsight, that probably made my stubby little ice axes all the worse for the job.",I am trying to register for some classes with a friend of mine who I don't really remember. The process involves running around between several different buildings delivering various codes from various people to various other people. ,"At one point I thought I lost one of the codes in question, but it didn't turn out to be a huge deal. Later this friend and I decide to go buy some bud, so we somehow get into contact with Sam Courts' housemate, who agrees to hook us up."," Sam apparently lives in a massive communal house now, with dozens of housemates, all of whom are throwing a party later that night. One guy is looking for acid, and Sam tells him he can be nude hooligan of the party.","I'm with my mother in a place which I would have otherwise assumed to be a naval shipyard, except that there were tons of civilians milling about everywhere as if the place where a shopping mall."," Indeed, some parts of the place did seem quite a bit like a shopping mall, and I have to assume that's why my mom and I were there in the first place.","All of a sudden, people start freaking out and running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and somebody starts yelling something about a gun. Before long it becomes quickly apparent that there are not one but two mass shooters."," I see one of them rounding a nearby corner and instantaneously hit the floor, rolling behind a large crate or box of some kind. I find a gun laying on the ground nearby me and grab it, only to realize that it is a paintball gun.","Regardless, I decide to use it anyway since I have nothing else to defend myself with. I notice there are a lot of police or military officers in the area, most of them behind cover, so I decide to take a risk and break my cover.","Popping up just above the lip I am hiding behind, I fire off a quick burst of paintballs, one of which happens to hit the guy in the nuts, stunning him just long enough to give some of the nearby officers enough time for an open shot.","In the aftermath of the event, there are a lot of military personal milling about, securing the area, questioning people, so on and so forth. ","It turns out that the shooter I was dealing with was a military personal himself, navy if I remember correctly, and it appears he was working in conjunction with Steve Wozniak, the Apple programmer. ","I hear a lot of strange conjecture as to the reasoning behind this event, including a bunch of theories relating to Apple's dirty business practices and sweatshop labor, but none of it really makes any sense whatsoever. ","Eventually I find my mom again, who I lost in all the chaos, and she is naturally ecstatic to see me in good health, as I her. ","As we are leaving the place, we walk along the docks and I got thoroughly engrossed at looking at the giant naval vessels, as if nothing had happened 5 minutes prior.","I'm hiking in the mountains with my family and some other people, the only one of whom I can actively identify being Tucker. ","As we are walking along, we run into some sort of school group on a field trip, and they are apparently doing some kind of nature studies or something and collecting small bits of flora and fauna to take back to their class, I presume.","I'm staying with a girl in some sort of hotel or apartment room, a sort of master suite with an attached bathroom and some bay windows overlooking some beautiful landscape. The girl and I are apparently absolutely infatuated with each other.","Apparently her family or relatives of some kind are staying nearby or something, and at some point I meet them briefly and I'm really unsure of whether our relationship would be approved of or not, so I don't think the subject ever gets brought up.",I have a lot of vague intimations of very soft lighting and warm ambiance.,"I'm catching a ride home from work one day with Ms Patu, apparently, and she decides that we're going to take a detour and stop by this place that I initially have no idea where is, but I eventually figure out is somewhere down in Sodo."," The complex appears to be some sort of industrial warehouse of some sort, and Ms Patu is apparently meeting someone she knows who works there for some reason or another. ","At some point I realize that the warehouse complex also houses what appears to be an IBM corporate management branch, and for some reason I apparently have an old ID card which I am under the impression used to get me into such places sometimes.","For kicks and giggles I tried one of the doors with the ID card and of course it gets rejected, but somehow through Ms Patus connections we still end up getting inside and I get to talk to some pretty cool people."," At some point my dad calls me and I tell him that I'll be home soon, and Ms Patu drives me back up to the north end of the city where I eventually make my way home. ","Also at some point we get a little bit lost in an unreasonably complex freeway interchange system in the vicinity of the industrial warehouse district, which at one point leads to us cutting across a grass field for unknown reasons.",I'm at a cabin nearby some little creek out in the woods which is apparently a nudist resort.,"I believe both family and friends are staying at the cabin with me, and we are all just chilling outside by the creek in the sun with some other people I don't really recognize.","There is apparently what appears to be some sort of abandoned military fortress built into the side of a cliff somewhat nearby, which is part of a series of peaks that are in the process of being scaled by a couple of rock climbing parties.","In particular, there is one technical climbing group ascending along the crack where the natural rock formations intercede with the flat expanse of concrete that is the military edifice sticking out like an obelisk.",The group has apparently gathered a small crowd from the creek and there is a group sort of making a picnic out of watching the climbers ascend while enjoying food and drink in the sunshine., I seem to remember some sort of barbeque running and people playing with a frisbee among other things. ,"At some point I got into a really interesting conversation with a couple of girls about something to do with abandoned military instillation, which somehow pertained the geology of the area or something like that.",I'm part of some defense grid holding some military base in parts unknown. I'm working in some little office closet sort of thing on a few display monitors that are apparently hooked up to a closed circuit computer system housing a shackled AI,"At some point some sort of emergency occurs and I decide to unshackle the AI and let him loose upon the greater computer system of the whole complex, at which point he employs some rather beautiful trickery to screw with a lot of people's heads.","I'm up in what I believe is Squamish, BC, driving around with my dad. Apparently both my brother and Bill Napier have houses in Squamish, like a block and a half away from each other. ","Somehow, however, my dad gets really lost going from one to the other, and we end up wandering around for a while and sort of running in circles. I think we were transporting some gear, like a mountain bike or something.","I'm at a party which is being held in my old house across the street. Apparently it's a good bit chaotic, and at some point I find myself in the master bathroom which is crammed with at least a half dozen people. ","Zach is standing next to me asking me all sorts of questions about something I'm not even really paying attention to, until at one point he looks at me dead serious and tells me he has the stats after all and shows me his arm.","On his arm are tattooed a series of icons from League of Legends: a Runaan's Hurricane, two Recurve Bows, and six Daggers.","I'm at Thurgood Marshall, and the school year is starting. I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing in the building, but I seem to be able to get where I need to be by simply closing my eyes, walking forward, and turning door handles on a whim."," At some point I find myself in the teacher's lounge, and I begin to realize that I am still physically on the Wonderland Trail, and can't possibly be at work. ","After that I just sort of float around the people briefly interacting with a variety of characters, realizing that I have no real duties or responsibilities to take care of.",I'm hiking through the mountains somewhere with a few friends with whom I belong to some sort of political organization.," I remember that we're being followed by somebody, and for that reason we have to continue moving, but I don't remember who is following us aside from that they consider us political dissidents."," After some time we find a sort of hut like structure build into a mountainside cave, which is apparently a well-stocked supply and rest hut for our organization. ","Once inside we are greeted very warmly by friendly faces and hot food, and much embracing follows. ","We break bread together at a main table of sorts, with one guy sitting under the table due to a full house and shortage of chairs, but no one minds and everyone makes space for each other. ",Also there's this sort of hut leader guy who appears to be head chef and maintains a watchful eye on the hut surroundings and such.,"I'm doing some grocery shopping with my dad at the Safeway in U Village. It's pretty close to closing time for the store, and customers are grabbing their last few items for purchase and my dad decides to take off and head home.","Somehow, though, he leaves behind his truck in the parking lot, with my bike still inside it. At first I think to myself that maybe I should drive the truck home, even though I have no license to drive, but I consider that to be too risky. ",Next I decide to ask some passersby whether they would be willing to drive the truck back to the house but then I realize they'd have no way of getting themselves home after that. ,"Finally I realized it was probably no big deal if the truck simply sat in the lot overnight, and as long as I had the keys to open the bed of the truck, I could get my bike out and get myself home. ","Just as I'm opening the truck up to do this, however, a security guard spots me and for some reason assumes that I'm attempting to steal the vehicle. ",My attempts to explain to him what I am doing and why I have the keys to the vehicle I'm attempting to get into apparently aren't enough to dissuade him from arresting me and taking me to the precinct to be processed.,I decide that my best course of action is to resist this process as little as possible and state my rights out loud so this guy knows he can't really screw with me.,Once we're at the precinct and the clerks on duty take a look at the report they just laugh it off as the guy being dumb and let me go.,I'm sitting in the back of a metro bus with Micah and a bunch of others from high school.,"I feel like the group was on its way back from some sort of convention or retreat or something, and everyone was engaged in various kinds of conversation on various topics. I think at one point I tried to explain Go to someone. ","At any rate, I just remember at one Lily talking for quite a while on some subject and thinking to myself that she was a lot smarter than I ever gave her credit for. Also I think it was Amanda who I explained Go to.","I'm with a bunch of others that are stuck in some kind of underground cave network, and apparently the group has just found a way outside through an old ruined outpost-type fort out in the woods, which has a door to the cave system in its cellar.","Apparently this exit from the caves has been sealed for some time, but someone managed to get it open, and people are eager to escape the cave system. ","Once outside, we are greeted by a small band of woodsmen who take us to safety, and I begin to fall in with them when it becomes apparent that my eyesight is of use to them.","At one point I am asked to climb a tree and look out across a big lake to ascertain whether there is any movement from another outpost on the far ridge, which there indeed is in the form of a patrolling guard. ",Also I think at some point we ran into some kind of representative of a race of miniature people who lived in the forest.,"I'm at some sort of park or other open public green space, hanging out with Fred, I believe, when out of nowhere Ali and Becca show up apparently just back from a trip to Japan. ","At some point Ali invites me to a music festival of some sort, and when I point out that I don't have a ticket he tells me to borrow his and take Becca to go see a particular show. ",Somehow we end up being followed by some shady characters and I end up having to fight them off battle-royal style in this crazy three-dimensional concrete maze structure.,"Also I remember Becca was wearing a knit kimono that looked half-way between a sweater and a dress, and I found it hilarious that she got such a thing from Japan.","I'm at some kind of house show deal being put on by Micah and a few of his friends. I remember Micah being busy setting up a bunch of sound equipment, guitars, amps, and such while everyone else is socializing in the living room of this house. ","I remember my brother being there with a few of his friends, and everyone was just sort of drinking and hanging out. ","There were also some Somali kids from school there, along with their parents, and before Micah's show got started, there was this rap performance sort of thing that was put on over a video composed of a bunch of clips from the ghettos in Soweto.", I specifically remember a verse or two being in Somali and all the Somali kids giggling about it. Also I remember the kids being fascinated by Micah's electric guitar while he was tuning it up.,"My mom and I get stranded somewhere on a little dinghy, what could have either been Lake Washington or the Pacific ocean down in the South America. ","At any rate, we somehow were paddling down some sort of river estuary when we got sucked out on a tidal current, after which we floated down the coast for a while until we found an establishment where we thought we might find help.",I think my mom and I decided it would be best to set up a shelter where we were and wait until the next day to try and do anything. ,"Also, the large body of water in question could also may well have been Lake Union, and at a point I thought it might have been, because I remember seeing a giant freeway interchange at one point which looked very out of place.","I'm at some sort of family gathering, with a number of members of my mom's side of my family in the kitchen making all kinds of food. ","I don't recognize the house we are in, but I find myself trying to avoid everyone in the kitchen by finding something to do downstairs. ","My dad comes down and urges me to join the rest of the family upstairs, so I head upstairs to hang out in the kitchen but quickly get into an argument with my dad about American foreign policy.","I'm playing some sort of Splinter Cell like character, who is on a boat in the middle of the ocean."," I have been given a crossbow and ordered to the upper decks, where I am to monitor a group of special forces from another country who are trying to sneak onto the boat."," They successfully do so, but we have a trap waiting for them on board, and we end up killing or capturing the entire team in a short little battle. ","Afterwards I somehow end up in temple of shorts, with a big clear pool of water and some sort of crystal flower thing floating above it. ","Some old lady of unknown origin is explaining how this is a temple to some unknowable life essence, who apparently has been helping out the US government here and there for years. The entity decides to speak a little. ","I end up just spending a while floating in the pool watching the crystal flower lazily bounce around. Also there is a much smaller little crystal pool, more like a shallow basin, which speaks to me as though something belonged in it.","However, when I grab the crystal flower and try and set it down in that basin, it flies away as though magnetically polar against the basin.","I'm arriving at the Go Center for what I thought was a regular Tuesday walk-in day, only apparently it's actually Wednesday, and the other people waiting out front are waiting for the SDK class."," When Andrew arrives, it's somehow decided that we're going to do away with the class altogether and go to some kind of party or some such other social function."," Somehow the process of getting to said function ends up being an adventure in and of itself, and I'm not sure we ever actually get to the thing. Also all the other SDK class regulars manage to disappear in the process.","I'm out on the playground at work, along with Ms. Helm and a bunch of the fifth graders. Ms. Helm calls for a huddle-up of sorts, and so I go over and take a seat on the ground near her. ","As the other students take a seat on the ground nearby as well, Ms. Helm begins to speak, though with great difficulty as she is struggling to find the right words for what she is trying to say.","At one point she decided to recite some rather beautiful poetry on the subject of making peace with others. At one point Annie handed me a pine needle as a gift, of sorts.","I'm with somebody who reminds me a lot of Ace in terms of looks and character, but with some distinct dissimilarities of personality."," We are wandering around somewhere or other and happen to come across some building which is something in between a church and a religious center of some kind, dedicated to people's spiritual health or something like that.", For whatever reason we decide to go inside and we end up in a room with a bunch of other people having some kind of meeting. ,The guy who is running the meeting is talking about various therapeutic methods of dealing with spiritual problems of various different kinds. ,"He is instructing us in a particular exercise that consists of trying to visualize our spiritual problems as various levels of a compression headache, essentially."," The top levels of the headache are supposed to be the largest, most abstract and existential of our problems, while the lowest levels are supposed to be the most immediate, visceral phenomena giving us trouble. ","Since apparently the guy I was with and I and had smoked some weed prior to coming to this meeting, he is acting in a manner that suggests that he is really high, and some of the other group members are definitely noticing his behavior. ","It doesn't really seem to be a problem with any of them, but it does make the situation noticeably more awkward for me as I am trying to participate faithfully in the meeting. ","Eventually the meeting gets around to me, and the guru guy ends up being really helpful actually in helping to articulate and discuss my various spiritual maladies. ","The room had a distinctly numerous amount of coolers and refrigerators for drinks and refreshments, all of which seemed to be very odd Japanese brand beverages in comically strange package designs.",Basically I was roadtripping across the US with Ben but we were on bicycles (which were occasionally mopeds) and eventually I got separated from Ben and was very hungry but couldnt decide between the small towns two stores that sold sub sandwiches.,I found Ben but he had decided that he was tired of biking so he took a bus to his girlfriend on the east coast and left his bike for me to deal with but both of our bikes  were broken.,I was stuck in a small town trying to sell my bike to repair his bike and continue on to the coast,I also very specifically remember at one point I was driving around a house and wrapping it around with rope that was pushing a giant electric blue orb i nto a slot in the side of the house (possibly to restore to power it?),iOS8 fucked up my phone and my alarm was super late work tried to call my boss to explain and he wouldn't talk to me,Boobs getting bigger was psychosomatic so if thought about your boobs growing they would. Non one knew about this except me.,Driving over the crest of a hill and seeing a carnival. There was giant pigs head and the teeth started moving and I realized they were a train/ride. ,"I kept having more and more nested dreams that were the same, so that I experienced waking up at 7:15 and hitting a five minute alarm easily a dozen times. When I finally woke up it felt like falling I fell through a lot of windows."
